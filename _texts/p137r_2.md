##  <span class="material">Huile tingente</span> to make metal runny 

   
 Take some <span class="material">mercury</span>, some real sublimate of <span class="material">venice</span>, and not sublimate of <span class="material">arsenic</span>, <span class="material">aes ustum a poix</span>, <span class="material">sal ammoniac</span>, <span class="material">a poix</span>. Ground everything separately, then blend them together in a <span class="tool">glass bottle</span>, and put it on <span class="material">warm ashes</span>. You will see that everything melts like wax, and will have bright colors. Leave to set, add a small quantity of this mixture on every metal, it will run marvelously.

>  <span class="profession">Foundry workers</span> who make large casts to mold statues, clean the dirt from these molds with <span class="material">calamine</span>, and a lot of <span class="material">sal ammoniac</span> in order to make moulds clear and neat. When they want to cast they add a lot of tin. Dampness and cold could spoil their works, that is the reason why even a small source of water in the hole can damage the whole thing.
