## To cast

 
<span class="activity"></span><span class="material">Asphalt</span> from <span class="place">Germany</span> is the most excellent sand you can find for molding in a box frame, because it is fitting for <span class="material">silver</span> & for <span class="material">gold</span>. And the more you use it and the older it is, the better it is. With it, one molds very slender & subtle things.
