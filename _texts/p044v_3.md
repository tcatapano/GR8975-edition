## White soporific oil

 
Have x or 12 Mandragore <span class="material">apples</span>, put them in quarters together with some <span class="material">olive oil</span> in a <span class="tool">glass bottle</span> which you will cook in a <span class="tool">bain marie</span> for two days and your oil will turn white with which you rub the sole of your feet and you will quickly feel sleepy.
