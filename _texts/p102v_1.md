## Painting on crystal or glass

 
<span class="activity"></span>They paint without any traces <span class="material">oil</span>, except for faces where they outline the nose and the mouth in very fine <span class="color">black</span> work. Then they make strokes and highlight them in <span class="color">white</span>, and then they apply a coat of <span class="color">flesh—tinted color</span>. As for the background, they do it in natural <span class="material">azur</span> from <span class="place">Acre</span> to make it more beautiful, or <span class="material">lacquer</span> for a quickly—done <span class="color">red</span>, or for a finer <span class="color">red</span>, <span class="material">dragon's blood</span>. But it is necessary to apply it little by little so that it is smooth and of one color, and in the same way for other colors. Then they apply underneath it, a leaf of <span class="material">topaz</span>, <span class="material">gold</span> or <span class="material">silver</span>.
