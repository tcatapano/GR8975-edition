## Molding <span class="animal">snakes</span>

 
When you get them for molding, if it is possible, do not remove their teeth if you [think you might] want to keep them, because having had their teeth removed, it hurts their gums and mouths, and they can no longer eat. You can keep [the snakes] in a <span class="tool">barrel</span> full of <span class="material">bran</span> or even better of <span class="material">earth</span>, in a cool place, or in a <span class="material">glass</span> <span class="tool">bottle</span>. And give them some live <span class="animal">frog</span> or other live <span class="animal">animal</span> because they do not eat anything that is dead. Also I have noticed that<div class="folio" align="center">- - - - - <a href="http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b10500001g/f224.image" target="_blank"><img src="https://cu-mkp.github.io/GR8975-edition/assets/photo-icon.png" alt="folio image: " style="display:inline-block; margin-bottom:-3px;"/>109v</a> - - - - - </div> when they want to bite or to eat something, they [snakes] do not go at it head on, but sideways and by sinuous coiling, as do <span class="name">Satan</span> and his henchmen. The <span class="animal">snake</span> has a small head, but a very large body; the entryway to sin seems small and inconsequential, but the consequences are great indeed. A <span class="animal">snake</span> can abstain from eating for seven or eight days, once he has swallowed a <span class="animal">frog</span>, and can swallow three or four <span class="animal">frogs</span>, one after the other, and what it has devoured does not rot and is not digested all at once in its stomach, but each part little by little, i.e. the bones and everything. The rest is just as fresh as when the <span class="animal">snake</span> ate it, such that when one bothers and torments it, it spits out what it swallowed up, which, in part, is totally digested, with the other part as fresh as if the <span class="animal">frog</span> were alive. It can hold a swallowed <span class="animal">frog</span> down for two or three <span class="time">hours</span> and spit it out alive.
