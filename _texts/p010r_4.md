##  Purple color 

 
 <span class="activity"></span>  <span class="profession">Painters</span> make it beautifully by first applying an undercoat of <span class="material_format">ordinary <span class="material">azur</span></span>, or better yet azure <span class="material">enamel</span>, and then they glaze it with <span class="material">lacquer</span>, which will be more appropriate for this if you mix in <span class="material">alum</span>, which will give it a violet tint depending on the quantity that you mix in.
