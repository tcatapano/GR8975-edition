##  Fish glue or usblac and mouth glue 

 
  It is made from <span class="material"><span class="animal">codfish</span> skin</span> that has been boiled rather than salted. <span class="profession">Joiners</span> use it on their masterpieces and <span class="profession">guitar makers</span> use it for their more delicate works.
