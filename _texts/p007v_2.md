## Against windy colic

 
 <span class="activity"></span> Take <span class="unit">a dozen</span> <span class="material_format">dried common <span class="material">walnuts</span></span> and throw them one after another onto <span class="tool">a good brazier</span> where they may catch fire, and take them out with <span class="tool">tongs</span>, and let them burn and flame well in the air, and extinguish them in <span class="unit">a glass</span> of <span class="material_format">good <span class="material">wine</span></span>. Then let the <span class="material">wine</span> cool and filter it, then pour <span class="unit">half</span> of it, since <span class="unit">six</span> extinguished nuts make <span class="unit">one dose</span>. An excellent cure against suffocation of the matrix.
