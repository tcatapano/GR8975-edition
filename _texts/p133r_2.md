## Casting the feet of small lizards in <span class="material">gold</span> and <span class="material">silver</span>

  <span class="activity"></span> <span class="activity"></span> 
Because the feet of these [<span class="animal">lizards</span>] that are very small are [also] very fine, once you have molded the top and you have uncover the vents and underneath the feet are covered lightly with <span class="material">wax</span>, and then cast a second mold. And the wax that one removes, it leaves a little cast for these said feet, and again such that the underneath [part] comes out in one piece that you can repair well, And the scales on top of the toes come [out] well.
