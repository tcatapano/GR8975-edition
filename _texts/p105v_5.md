## <span class="animal">Nightingale</span>

 
<span class="activity"></span>It will need a cage made in the shape of a barn, like the ones for <span class="animal">larks</span>, lined with <span class="color">green</span> <span class="material">fabric</span>, because it feels the cold. And to get it to eat when it is first put in the cage, you must give it <span class="animal">ants</span> mixed with <span class="material">earth</span> in the bottom of the cage to get it used to pecking, and you can give it <span class="material">minced <span class="animal">sheep</span>'s heart</span>, and sometimes <span class="material">eggs</span>, and sometimes <span class="animal">mealworm</span>.
