##  <span class="tool">Clamps</span> 

  <span class="activity"></span> 
 To make <span class="tool">clamps</span> use <span class="tool">flat tongs</span> made from wire, which is reheated and bent, and hammered on <span class="tool">anvil</span>. Since those <span class="tool">clamps</span> are thinner, they burn more easily, being used in reheated molds. So use new clamps.
