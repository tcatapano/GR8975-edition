## Lights

 
Your <span class="tool">brush</span> shows it to you by making some shadow which must always follow the back of your hand, not in a straight line like this, <span class="figure"></span> because the light would be too crude and too harsh, but obliquely and as an incline like this. <span class="figure"></span><span class="figure"></span> It is necessary that the painting is not facing the light, but be half turned back against it, and above all look for a soft light, for it makes a soft shadow and soft work, like a harsh light makes a harsh work.
