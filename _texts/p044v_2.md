## Excellent water against the pest by the Master of Montorsin

 
Take some <span class="material">theriac rue</span>, <span class="material">dittany</span> and good <span class="material">vinegar</span>, put the whole in a <span class="tool">glass bottle</span> and leave it halfâ€”open and well attached. And put it in a <span class="tool">bath</span> for three or 4 days. Then take some of your brew from its container when you need it and pour some, when necessary, on a red hot <span class="tool">tile</span> and receive the vapor and also perfume your clothes. This is a very precious and proved secret.
