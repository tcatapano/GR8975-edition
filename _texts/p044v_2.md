## Excellent water against the pest by the Master of Montorsin

 
Take some theriac rue, dittany and good vinegar, put the whole in a glass bottle and leave it halfâ€”open and well attached. And put it in a bath for three or 4 days. Then take some of your brew from its container when you need it and pour some, when necessary, on a red hot tile and receive the vapor and also perfume your clothes. This is a very precious and proved secret.
