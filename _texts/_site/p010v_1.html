<p>## For painting in <span class="material">oil</span> on <span class="material">taffeta</span> without the <span class="material">oil</span> running</p>

<p><span class="activity"></span> One needs to make a layer of <span class="material"><span class="foreign">batture</span></span>, which is made of <span class="material"><span class="foreign">colle forte</span></span> soaked for <span class="time">24 hours</span> in <span class="material">water</span> then gently boiled so it is not too strong. Then stir in a little <span class="material">honey</span> to soften it, and bring it all to a boil. And on top of this layer, which will soon be dry, you will be able to paint in <span class="material">oil</span>, which will soften the layer even more, and which will also serve to make an underlayer for <span class="material">gold</span>. <span class="material">Alum water</span> also keeps <span class="material">oil</span> from running.</p>
