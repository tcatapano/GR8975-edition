<p>## Varied and transmuted wine</p>

<p>Grate Brazilwood very fine, let it soak for one or two hours in clear water. Then take this tinted water and add some clear water and you will make wine as clear as you like. If you please, put a drop of juice of lemon or of orange in it and it will immediately become white. You can drink it without danger.</p>
