<p>## Pewtermaker</p>

<p>They mix viii or ten pounds of lead for each hundredweight of tin in the cities that have regulated guilds. But elsewhere, they add as much as they can. One also uses ii. lb. of estaim de glace to bind it and three lb. of broken brass, that is, copper scrap that kettlemakers make. This makes the vessel more reverberant and it is not as breakable.</p>

<p>This pewter is called ordinary pewter.</p>
