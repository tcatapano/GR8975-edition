##  Molding a single vine leaf</p>

<p>Attach it with brass wire points on the jacket of clay and then cast the first mold. Once it is dry peel off the back side and make the second cast. Then peel away the back side, and make your second cast. Once it is dry, you may remove the leaf. You must heat your mold only once, because there is nothing to be burnt inside.</p>
