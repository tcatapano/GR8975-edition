<p>## casts</p>

<p>If the medal is very thick, do not pour a cast that is as thick; the cast just needs to be half as thick as the medal. But if it is thin, make a cast that is of the same thickness. Do not forget to make vents in the cast or the whole matter will fill with bubbles.</p>

  <p>Never forget to oil the cast with wax when you cast herbs or flowers, otherwise it will break and cannot be taken out.</p>
