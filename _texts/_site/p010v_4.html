<p>Hardâ€”boil some <span class="material">eggs</span>, cut them in half and take the <span class="material">yolks</span> out, and between the two halves of the <span class="material">white</span> put a bit of <span class="material">ceruse</span>, and tie the two halves together with <span class="tool"><span class="material">thread</span></span>.
