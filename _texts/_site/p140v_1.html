<p>## To cast in <span class="material">sulfur</span></p>

<p>To cast neatly in <span class="material">sulfur</span>, arrange the pith of <span class="tool">bread</span> under the <span class="tool">brazier</span>, as you know. Mold whatever you want into it &amp; let it dry &amp; you will have very neat work.</p>

  <p>Try <span class="material">sulfur</span> passed through melted <span class="material">wax</span>, because it will no longer ignite &amp; and make eyelets.</p>
