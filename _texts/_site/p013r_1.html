<p>## Flesh color with arsenic</p>

<p>Sublimated arsenic, that is to say, the white kind sold as stone, when powdered on marble, mixed with vermilion or laque or mine, produces a beautiful flesh color that always shines. Yellow arsenic has a very beautiful color, the white one works well in oil and goes well with lake.</p>
