<p>## Varnish</p>

<p>Turpentine oil: turpentine &amp; good eau de vie, to dry it out; heat it without mixing on the stove, so that it mixes of its own accord in melting. After, test it on a very clean blade, &amp; you will know from this whether it has enough body and whether it does not flow too much.</p>
