<p>## Glassmakerâ€™s black</p>

<p>Filings of iron taken from bars that have been in the fire for a long time, which are thick, are much better than the common soft ones that fall under the anvil in the forge, because they imitate niello. To said black, described elsewhere, some people add a little minium.</p>
