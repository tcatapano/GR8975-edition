<p>##  Moulders from Foix</p>

<p>Those who mould from across the way make their sand from crocum ferri and calcinated slate, but slate always retains its bumpiness and swells because it is a fatty. In the noyau, it is not good; in sand, it can be put to use. They the moulders from Foix sieve their sand, grind it on porphyry, and soak it in water, and they keep the finest bits which are on the top, then they reheat it.</p>
