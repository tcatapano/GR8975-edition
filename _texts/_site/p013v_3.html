<p>## Toadstone</p>

<p>That which comes from the head of the toad and has the shape of the toad, painted naturally as you have seen, is the most excellent. It is said that if powder made from it is put on a brazier in someoneâ€™s room at night, they will be unable to move, speak, or stop thieves.</p>
