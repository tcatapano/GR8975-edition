<p>##  <span class="material">Paper</span></p>

<p><span class="activity"></span> <span class="activity"></span>  The <span class="color">whitest</span> and thinnest is the best. And when the <span class="tool">hollow mold</span> is quite clean, as when it is made of <span class="material">sulfur</span> or <span class="material_format">baked <span class="material">cimolee</span></span>, the <span class="material">paper</span> comes out very clean. You can apply a layer or two of <span class="material"><span class="color">white</span></span>, with a border of <span class="material">gold</span>, to imitate <span class="material">alabaster</span>. And after applying the <span class="material"><span class="color">white</span></span> you may burnish it with a <span class="tool">tooth</span>.  Yet in order for it to take burnish you should soak the <span class="material">lead <span class="color">white</span></span> with <span class="material">egg white</span> and <span class="material_format">peelings from the <span class="material"><span class="plant">fig tree</span></span></span>. Or better still, varnish your work with <span class="material"><span class="color">white</span> varnish</span>. Also while you are molding with <span class="material">paper</span>, as it starts drying, burnish the back of it with the <span class="tool">tooth</span>.</p>
