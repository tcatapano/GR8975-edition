<p>## Painting enamel azure in oil</p>

<p><span class="activity"></span>  This is a secret that is hardly known to common painters. Some take the most delicate they can &amp; crush it with <span class="material">ceruse</span>, which binds it, and next prick with an <span class="tool">awl</span> in several places the area they want to paint with <span class="material"><span class="foreign">azur d’esmail</span></span>, such that the <span class="material">oil</span> enters &amp; leaks in, &amp; does not cause the <span class="material">azure</span>, which in itself is heavy, to run. Others lay the panel flat &amp; apply the <span class="material">azure</span> on it, which is also done <span class="foreign">à destrempe</span>. The main thing is to crush it well on <span class="tool"><span class="material">marble</span></span>, and before that, to have washed it thoroughly. Some grind it with thoroughly with an <span class="material">egg yolk</span> &amp; then wash it in five or six lots of <span class="material">water</span> and lay it on not with a <span class="tool"><span class="foreign">painceau</span></span>, which would be too soft, but with a <span class="tool"><span class="foreign">broisse</span></span> highly softened &amp; bent, &amp; laying it on thickly as if one were applying it with a <span class="tool">trowel</span>; settling down it evens out and flattens. I have experienced that crushing <span class="material"><span class="foreign">azur d’esmail</span></span> with <span class="material">egg yolk</span> &amp; then washing it in several lots of <span class="material">water</span> is good, although it loses a little of its vividness in the crushing of it. I have also washed it in several lots of <span class="material">water</span> &amp;, when it had settled a little, I removed the <span class="material">water</span>, still q blue, with a <span class="tool">sponge</span> and squeezed it into another vessel thus where it settled, &amp; from the residue I had the <span class="material">ash</span>, <span class="material"><span class="plant">flower</span></span> and subtlest part of the <span class="material">azure</span> without crushing it, which is the best, for in the crushing of it, it loses some of its color. Those who make it in <span class="place">Germany</span> compose it like <span class="material">enamel</span>, in large pieces which they <span class="tool">pestle</span>, &amp; pass through several <span class="tool">sieves</span> &amp; wash.</p>

<p>To make <span class="material">azures</span> beautiful, they wash or soak them in a <span class="material_format">rock <span class="material">water</span></span>, as they call it; it is a <span class="material">water</span> distilled from mines where <span class="material">azure</span> or <span class="material"><span class="foreign">vert d’azur</span></span> is found, which distills naturally through the mountain’s veins or is distilled with an <span class="tool">alembic</span> par from <span class="material_format">&gt;mineral <span class="material">stones</span></span> of <span class="material">azure</span> or <span class="material">copper</span>.</p>

<p><span class="material_format"><span class="material">Azure</span> ashes</span> are only good for landscapes because they die in <span class="material">oil</span>. Only true <span class="material">azure</span> lasts. <span class="material"><span class="foreign">Azur d’esmail</span></span> cannot be worked if it is too coarse. Try it, therefore, on the fingernail or the <span class="tool"><span class="material">oil</span> palette</span>. If it happens to be sandy, do not crush it except with the <span class="material">egg yolk</span> or, better yet, wash it in <span class="material_format">clear <span class="material">water</span></span> &amp; with a sponge remove the <span class="material_format">colored <span class="material">water</span></span> after it starts to go to the bottom, and in this manner you will extract the quite delicate <span class="material"><span class="plant">flower</span></span>, which will be easy to work with.</p>
