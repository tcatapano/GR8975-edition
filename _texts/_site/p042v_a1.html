<p>## Pounce for scratching satin</p>

<p>After pouncing with crushed flour or chalk, in order that the dots of the pounce not be erased, go over the trace with egg white beaten with the milk or bark of a fig tree, which will immediately make the egg white clear up like water, without becoming opaque, it will maintain the trace that you will go over again and scratch with a piece of glass or penknife.</p>
