It has to be heated over a <span class="tool">closed fire</span>, such as a <span class="tool">reverberatory furnace</span> or <span class="tool"><span class="foreign">fours de barbiers</span></span>. The more freshly heated, the better it is to work with. It should be finely crushed on <span class="tool"><span class="material">marble</span></span>. After preparing your <span class="tool">hollow mold</span> of <span class="material">sulfur</span> or another [material] and <span class="material">oil</span>ing it and surrounding it with a <span class="tool">circle</span>, soak your <span class="material">plaster</span> in <span class="material">water</span>, not too thick, and rub it well with your finger, and if it makes bubbles, throw on more <span class="material_format">powder of the said <span class="material">plaster</span></span> and crush it with your finger until \+
