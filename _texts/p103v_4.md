## Earwax

 
<span class="activity"></span>If you take enough with the tip of an <span class="tool">ear picker</span> and you sieve it with <span class="material">foam of urine</span>, which often forms in the <span class="material">urine</span> of those who have a headache, all the foam will dissipate.
