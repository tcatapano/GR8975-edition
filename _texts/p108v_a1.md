## [Stone alum]

 
<span class="activity"></span><span class="material">Stone alum</span> must be reheated in a <span class="tool">pot</span> covered with a <span class="tool">tile</span> over a good <span class="material">charcoal</span> fire so that the impurities which might be in it [are] burned with that which does not burn. This is done either in the <span class="tool">goldsmith forge</span> surrounded by <span class="material">bricks</span> or in a little <span class="tool">oven</span> vented to the fusion fire such that the <span class="tool">pot</span> stays red for a quarter of an <span class="time">hour</span>. This is more to purify it than for anything else. It becomes <span class="color">reddish</span> on top and the inside remains <span class="color">white</span> and dries best this way.#

> <span class="activity"></span> # Once your <span class="material">stone alum</span> is cooled down, crush it in a <span class="tool">mortar</span>, then grind it more finely on <span class="tool"><span class="material">marble</span></span>. And this makes it into very fine wooly dust that gives binding to <span class="material">sand</span> without burning like all other things. [This is] a beautiful invention. Crush it on the <span class="tool">mortar</span> to being careful to keep the grindings together because the dust flying can get down your collar or on your face which can have very grave consequences. Put a little each time in the <span class="tool">mortar</span> to avoid the dust flying. It is best to grind therefore with the <span class="tool">pestle</span> trained on the <span class="tool">mortar</span> rather than on the <span class="tool"><span class="material">marble</span></span> where it spreads and on the <span class="tool">mortar</span> it gathers [the dust] from all sides and renders it very fine and sweet to the touch.
