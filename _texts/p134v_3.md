##  Secret for soldering small works made of <span class="material">gold</span> and <span class="material">silver</span> 

   <span class="activity"></span> 
 If some little pieces of legs cannot be easily removed from <span class="material">gold</span> or <span class="material">silver</span> casting, it is because you didn't cast wax under these parts. Beat some soldering <span class="material">gold</span> very finely, then cut it into very fine flakes, cut the quantity you need. Take some of this phlegm or white and thick saliva which is on the teeth, put some of this matter to the place you want to solder with the point of a <span class="tool">burin</span>, then place your flakes, then put to the opposite part a mixture made of a small quantity of soaked fat earth and saliva, thanks to the mixture the solder will better adhere. Then pulverize a bit of <span class="material">borax</span> on it, and heat up <span class="material">Quince pulp seed water</span> to a boil and others too.
