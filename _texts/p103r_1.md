## Excellent burn relief

 
<span class="activity"></span>Heat <span class="material">linseed oil</span> on a light fire, without letting it boil and simmer. But when it is hot put a quarter part(of the quantity of the <span class="material">linseed oil</span>) of the newest <span class="material">wax</span> you can find. Once it has melted, let it cool and when it begins to curdle, stir it continuously with a new <span class="tool">wooden spatula</span> for the length of time it takes to say 9 <span class="foreign"><span class="time">pater nosters</span></span>, and while you say them, wash this composition with <span class="material">holy water</span>, always stirring. Having said the first of 9 <span class="foreign"><span class="time">pater nosters</span></span>, pour the first <span class="material">water</span> out and add more, then wash and stir the composition for the time it takes to say 8 <span class="foreign"><span class="time">pater nosters</span></span>. In the interval it takes to say 3 of the 7 <span class="foreign"><span class="time">pater nosters</span></span>, and continuing thusly, add more <span class="material">water</span>, as above, until there is only one last new <span class="foreign"><span class="time">pater noster</span></span> left. Then you will have a soft <span class="color">white</span> <span class="material">ointment</span>, with which you will apply to the burn for 9 <span class="time">days</span>. But don't apply any more, you must let the flesh grow over. Dress it twice a <span class="time">day</span> and each time you wash your face with <span class="material">water</span>, and mix it together a bit tepidly, without rubbing. But press it with <span class="tool">wet linen</span>, and wipe it similarly with <span class="tool">fine linen</span>, and apply the <span class="material">ointment</span>. On which you can put <span class="tool">binder's string</span>. This will regrow your hair and prevent a scar from forming. A <span class="material">powder</span> maker who was completely burnt but had no sign of burns taught it to me.
