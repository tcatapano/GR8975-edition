## Vinegar

 
One takes for granted that jec heat redâ€”hot the <span class="material">mineral salt</span> that looks like <span class="material">marble</span> & that is called in <span class="place">Catalonia</span> & at the border of <span class="place">Spain</span> <span class="material">Cardana salt</span>C, & throwing it in the red hot or quite hot in <span class="material">wine</span>, it turns it into very good <span class="material">vinegar</span>. Some make it with <span class="material">water</span> poured on <span class="material">pomace</span> soured after being pressed by <span class="tool">grape pickers</span>, but it will not keep & spoils in heat & thunder storms.
