##  Lute for luting your molds 

 
I have not found a lute that is made more quickly than this one, nor a better one. Take some of the <span class="material">lean earth that artillery founders and bell founders use to make their trusseaulx and molds, which is lean and sandy</span>. Soak it moderately like a very thick mortar. Mix into it about one half of <span class="material">horse manure</span> and then beat it well. Afterwards mix in one third of <span class="material">cloth waste or cloth shavings</span> and beat it again quite strongly. You can reheat your mold as soon as the lute is ready.
