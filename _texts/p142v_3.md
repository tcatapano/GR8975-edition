##  Lute for luting your molds 

  <span class="activity"></span> 
I have not found a <span class="material">lute</span> that is made more quickly than this one, nor a better one. Take some of the <span class="material">lean earth that artillery founders and bell founders use</span> to make their trusseaulx and molds, which is lean and sandy. Soak it moderately like a very thick <span class="material">mortar</span>. Mix into it about one half of <span class="material">horse manure</span> and then beat it well. Afterwards mix in one third of <span class="material">cloth waste</span> or <span class="material">cloth shavings</span> and beat it again quite strongly. You can reheat your mold as soon as the <span class="material">lute</span> is ready.
