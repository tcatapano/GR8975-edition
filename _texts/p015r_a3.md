## Casting <span class="material">gold</span> and <span class="material">silver</span>

 
The <span class="material">sand</span> must be made from something very dry and arid and reheated well because, if it were humid, like <span class="material_format"><span class="profession">founder</span>'s <span class="material">sand</span></span>, the <span class="material">gold</span> and <span class="material">silver</span> would leap out of the <span class="tool">mold</span> and sustain damage. It is also necessary for the <span class="material">earth</span> to absorb the <span class="material">metal</span> because <span class="material_format">cast <span class="material">gold</span></span> or <span class="material_format">cast <span class="material">silver</span></span> becomes very porous. That is why it must be beaten out again, otherwise it is brittle, as seen in spoon handles.
