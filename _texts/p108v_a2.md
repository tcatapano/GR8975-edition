## [Clay]

 
<span class="activity"></span><span class="material">Clay</span> used to surround molds, should be very fat and malleable, and should not be used for anything else except to make the contour of the molds. Therefore one should only choose that which is very fat and beat it very well and soak it moderately with <span class="material">water</span> and have it in a pit or <span class="tool">earthenware pot</span> and make good holes with a <span class="tool">stick</span> with which one replenishes it with <span class="material">water</span> to keep it always fresh and soft and ready to use when needed.
