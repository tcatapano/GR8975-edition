## For molding from <span class="material">sulfur</span>

 
 <span class="activity"></span>  <span class="material">Sulfur</span> is made beautiful by mixing in <span class="material">soot <span class="color">black</span></span> or <span class="material_format">powdered <span class="material">sanguine</span></span>, which makes it harder and stronger. After letting it melt entirely until it becomes liquid and similar to <span class="material">oil</span>, then mixing it with <span class="material">verdigris</span>, you can use it for casting a <span class="animal">lizard</span> or something else in <span class="material">plaster</span>, very cleanly.

Use <span class="material_format"><span class="color">yellow</span> <span class="material">sulfur</span> of the best kind</span>, as the <span class="material_format"><span class="color">grey</span>ish natural <span class="material">sulfur</span></span> is no good. Don't cast it in the wind and cold for it would fill with bubbles.
