## Casting <span class="material">metal</span>s

 
Candlesticks and small works are cast in a <span class="tool">frame</span> with <span class="material">sand</span>. Having stamped the work, sprinkle it with <span class="material">flour</span> in order to make the <span class="material">copper</span> or <span class="material">latten</span> run better. When the <span class="material">sand</span> has been in use for one month, it is necessary to take some new <span class="material">sand</span> because that which has been used, being reheated \+, dries & loses its binding power. Yet it is used mixed with the new <span class="material">sand</span>, because it makes the work less porous. Large works such as artillery, bells and similar things are cast in <span class="material">earth</span>, and <span class="material">copper</span> cast in <span class="material">earth</span> makes less crust and is <span class="color">white</span>r than when cast in <span class="material">sand</span>. The <span class="material">earth</span> is <span class="material_format">sandy <span class="material">clay</span></span> mixed with <span class="material"><span class="animal">horse</span> dung</span> and <span class="material_format"><span class="material">cloth</span> waste</span>. The <span class="material">earth</span> that has been used for casting, which is <span class="color">black</span>, baked and as if burnt, is mixed with <span class="material_format">artificial <span class="material">sand</span></span>, and is very good. For softening and making the <span class="material">copper</span> run, once it is melted, one throws in some <span class="material">lead</span>, which does not form an alloy but is found on the surface of the cast.
