## Second Casting

 
<span class="activity"></span>When you have well molded the first part of the <span class="animal">animal</span>, that is to say the back, the spine, and the entire top part, and when the half‚Äîmold where the part is encased is hard enough <span class="figure"></span> turn over the bottom and the sides of the belly, sometimes using a <span class="tool">knife</span> for the thicker parts, and then with a <span class="tool">pen‚Äîknife</span> for the places where the more fragile parts are encased, like legs, tail, and similar things. Because the head is higher, you will have to dig deeper to expose it and do a deeper notch that has to be well exposed, by enlarging it from the outside, in order for the second mold that you cast on top of it releases well. A process for which the <span class="animal">animal</span> himself can be useful because his nature so permits. However, make sure that you reveal the <span class="animal">lizard's</span> throat more than you would do a <span class="animal">snake</span>, because the <span class="animal">lizard</span> has big jaws and big bones that do not cast as easily, and has deep ears in which the <span class="material">wet sand</span> is not as easy to remove. But you will avoid all of this if you expose half of the head and those things that you know do not release easily. When everything is well exposed, blow over it and wipe each part again with a <span class="tool">cloth made of swine hair</span>, slightly dampened into <span class="material">salt water</span> or <span class="material">clear water</span>, do that gently, that way the lower part of your uncovered <span class="animal">animal</span> will be very neat. # <span class="material">üùã</span> Once it is done, dip the covered side of your mold into <span class="material">water</span> for a <span class="foreign"><span class="unit">pater noster</span></span>. It will suck <span class="material">water</span> inside, that way when you'll rub with <span class="material">oil</span> the uncovered side, the <span class="material">oil</span> will remain on the top, and to prevent the second cast which you will cast on top from sticking. Dip your mold into <span class="material">water</span>, take a particularly <span class="tool">fine brush</span> and rub with <span class="material">oil</span> the entire mold but the <span class="animal">animal</span>; it should not be touched with <span class="material">oil</span>. Make sure to use you brush between the parts and on all the fragile parts. And if by mistake <span class="material">oil</span> is soaked, dip the mold into <span class="material">water</span>, as it is said above, and drop by drop the <span class="material">oil</span> will come back to the top.

It is at the level of the head that you must make the biggest notch and you should start at that notch to expose and then keep following by looking at the traces left by the <span class="tool">tacks</span>.

This thus prepared, put your first half‚Äîmold on the disc of <span class="material">clay</span>, surround it with a <span class="material">clay</span> circle and do a thickness mark similar to the first one. Then, with a rather <span class="tool">thick brush</span>, wet with <span class="material">spirits</span> all your <span class="animal">animal's</span> exposed half, without, if possible, missing any part, because therein lies the secret to casting neatly. Then, as fast as possible before the <span class="material">spirits</span> evaporate, soak your <span class="material">sand</span>, and cast it, shaking, blowing, and moving the mold, as you did for the first one, making sure that what you pour first on the <span class="animal">animal</span> is clearer than the rest, so that it is soaked everywhere and highlights the finer parts. So, leave it for fifteen <span class="unit">minutes</span> so it sets, then remove the <span class="material">clay</span> circle and disc. And, with a <span class="tool">knife</span>, join you two molds together in a longish form, like a mandore, as we say, because of how you cast. Then soak a little in <span class="material">water</span> the whole mold up to the level of the joints. Because this is another secret to separate them more easily. Otherwise, you would break everything. Separate them like this skillfully. After this, gently and patiently remove half of the <span class="animal">animal</span> still in the mold, pulling it sometimes on one side and sometimes on the other, in order to avoid breaking it, or ruining parts of the mold. The mold, being empty, rejoin both half so that no <span class="material">dust</span> comes in, and put them aside until you want to heat them up, make the <span class="tool">runners</span>, the <span class="tool">vents</span> and put the <span class="tool">clamps</span>. As for the <span class="animal">animal</span>, to avoid it drying, and in order to be be able to use it to mold 4 or 5 of times, put it on <span class="material">water</span>. I believe that it would be better preserved in <span class="material">spirits</span>. However, it would be best to make the 4 or 5 molds the same day because these <span class="animal">animals</span> rot and will smell within the <span class="unit">day</span>. Having left your molds to dry out, for they will stay humid for at least a <span class="unit">month</span>, make the vents for one half.

> \+ Note that once you have made your second casting, if you left your mold without opening it for a <span class="unit">day</span> or a <span class="unit">night</span>, you would then need to put it into hot <span class="material">water</span> or reheat it, rather than open it, like for the <span class="animal">crab</span>.

> If after both halfs of the <span class="foreign">noyau</span> have set and hardened, it would not open if you did not dip it into <span class="material">water</span>. But as you dip the back of your mold into <span class="material">water</span>, <span class="material">oil</span> comes back to the top and touches the joints which separates them.

> However, be sure that your second mold is thick enough, and hard enough otherwise it could break while dipping it into <span class="material">water</span> if you want to open it. To avoid this mistake dip the entire mold into <span class="material">water</span> and rub it everywhere, if the mold has set enough it will harden. Then take both molds with a <span class="tool">rough cloth</span>, in order to grip it better. Then strongly separate the molds as if you wanted to tear <span class="material">bread</span> apart. But in case it breaks, rejoin them, and fortifies the joints with <span class="tool">clamps</span>.
