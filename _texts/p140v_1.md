## To cast in <span class="material">sulfur</span>

 
 To cast neatly in <span class="material">sulfur</span>, arrange the pith of <span class="tool">bread</span> under the <span class="tool">brazier</span>, as you know. Mold whatever you want into it & let it dry & you will have very neat work.

>  Try <span class="material">sulfur</span> passed through melted <span class="material">wax</span>, because it will no longer ignite & and make eyelets.
