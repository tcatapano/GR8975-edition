##  Reddening lively crayfish which will look as if they were boiled 

  <span class="activity"></span> 
 Rub your <span class="animal">crayfish</span> with good <span class="material">vinegar</span> diluted with a little <span class="material">eau—de—vie</span> and not much, then you can present them as if they were cooked and yet they will walk.
