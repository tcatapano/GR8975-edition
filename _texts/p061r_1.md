## Skin colors

 
It is necessary that you make it of two kinds, one more <span class="color">red</span> to make the main layer, the other more pale for the highlights, as around the eyes. And then on this last skin color, you will touch lightly the main lights with a little <span class="material">white lead</span>. But avoid applying too much of it because this will look like a face of death. The beautiful <span class="material">Florence lacquer</span> makes a beautiful vivid skin color that resembles the complexion of <span class="color">alexandrine pink</span> and <span class="color">incarnadine</span>
.

>  Certain colors need to be ground like minium or massicot. The <span class="material">ashes</span> don't need to be ground at all.
