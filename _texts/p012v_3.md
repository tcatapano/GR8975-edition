## To <span class="color">white</span>n <span class="material">enilanroc</span>

 
Some believe the ceruse—color crust that is on top to be natural. Others say that it is a lost secret of ancient <span class="profession">lapidaries</span>. Others say that it is <span class="material">enamel</span> that has been reheated. And, from this crust, one can form multiple ciphers, letters, circles and other bizarre motifs. As to the means, I proceeded thus: I once wanted to add a layer of <span class="material">arsenic</span> ground on <span class="material">marble</span>. However, I did the experiment without it, and I put the above mentioned thing, <span class="material">enilanroc</span>, in a <span class="tool">small <span class="material">iron</span> casket</span> on the <span class="tool">fire</span> of my <span class="tool"><span class="profession">goldsmith</span>'s forge</span> with three or four <span class="material_format">small half—burnt <span class="material">coal</span>s</span> and blew on it only with my <span class="tool">mouth</span>. However, the thing caught fire and became all <span class="color">white</span>, not only on its surface but also inside. And then I let it cool on its own near the <span class="tool">fire</span>, since otherwise, exposing it suddenly to cold air, it would have cracked. While it was all <span class="color">white</span>, I passed it through my <span class="tool"><span class="material">lead</span> wheel</span> and I found it to be as hard as it was before. And after scraping off a little of the <span class="color">white</span>, I found it to be of <span class="color">a clear fleshy tone</span>. Finally, I polished it and observed that it took quite a beautiful polish luster and that it could compare with a quite beautiful <span class="material">agate</span> for the purpose of engraving it with some beautiful face and applying it to a table of

 <span class="material">agate</span> of various colors. But because this overall <span class="color">white</span>ness did not correspond with the <span class="color">white</span> crust on the surface that I was seeking, leaving the rest of the thing its <span class="color">natural color</span>, I made a hole in a <span class="tool"><span class="material">brick</span></span>, precisely the same size as the object, and put it inside. Then I heated two <span class="tool"><span class="profession">glassmaker</span>'s soldering iron</span>s until they became <span class="color">red</span> hot and, when they were <span class="color">red</span> hot, I applied them one after the other onto the surface of the object until I got the <span class="color">white</span> crust I was looking for, on which I made the drawing that I wanted, revealing the <span class="color">red</span> background, with a <span class="tool">diamond point</span>, and I polished it with <span class="tool">hog bristles</span> and <span class="tool"><span class="material">tripoli</span></span>. I don't know if it would be better to reheat it under <span class="tool"><span class="material_format">hot <span class="material">ashes</span></span></span>, and if it would be good to encase it in <span class="tool"><span class="material">alabaster</span></span>, which is quite cold, as I did in the <span class="tool"><span class="material">brick</span></span>.
