## Wax for seals and impressions

 
For large wax seals, you should always have tepid <span class="material">water</span> handy, and keep your <span class="material">wax</span> in it. Yet previously you should have kneaded it with your hands, so as to make it very smooth and even, for otherwise the water would penetrate the wax and prevent it from holding together. Afterwards, you can imprint whatever you want. Cover the wax in three or four sheets of <span class="material">paper</span>, and, with a round and smooth <span class="tool">stick</span> similar to a <span class="tool">pestle</span>, roll it out as if to polish it. It will then stick to the paper, helping you to take it off from the seal. In this way you will imprint better than if you were dripping molten wax. You can carve figures and color them in gold, in silver, or paint them with <span class="material">couleurs à vernis</span>, and transfer them onto a <span class="material">glass pane</span> painted with <span class="material">couleurs à tourmentine</span> & <span class="material">mastic</span>. And if you want to apply these designs by inlaying, use <span class="material">gum ammoniacum</span> mixed with <span class="material">vinegar</span>, and it will stick well.
