## Against nose bleeding and for dyeing

 
Pound some of the kind of <span class="material">vinete</span> or <span class="material">lapathum acutum</span> that is red—veined, which is called <span class="material">dragon's blood</span>, and apply it on the bleeding person's forehead. This herb is a strong dye & makes beautiful violet.
