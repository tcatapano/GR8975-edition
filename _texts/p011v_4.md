## Making <span class="tool"><span class="material">diamond</span> points</span> for engraving

 
 <span class="activity"></span>  These are for sketching what you want to draw on <span class="material">stones</span> and for engraving. When these points are too dull and cannot engrave, it is necessary to rub <span class="material">diamond</span> against <span class="material">diamond</span>; one can rub them with <span class="material_format"><span class="material">pumice stone</span> powder</span>. It is necessary to strip what you want to engrave on a <span class="tool"><span class="material">lead</span> wheel</span> or with a <span class="material">stone</span> or with <span class="material">glass</span>, because the polishing is like <span class="material">varnish</span> or <span class="material">glass</span> and stops the <span class="material">diamond</span> or <span class="material">sapphire</span> from engraving well. This is why it does not engrave easily on <span class="material">horn</span>, which is polished and fat. But when the polish has been taken off, it is easy to engrave.
