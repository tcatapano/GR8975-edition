## Polishing a <span class="tool"><span class="material">copper</span> wheel</span>

 
 <span class="activity"></span>  Instead of polishing your <span class="material">stone</span>, it is necessary to remove the <span class="material">grease</span> by rubbing <span class="tool"><span class="material_format">the flesh side of a piece of <span class="material">leather</span></span></span> on the wheel, all while spinning the wheel if you have not worked on it in a long time.
