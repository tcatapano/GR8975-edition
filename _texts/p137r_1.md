## Casting <span class="material">red copper</span>

  <span class="activity"></span> 
 Pure cauldron <span class="material">red copper</span>, or copper of any other small works, is good to cast. To make it runny, add some <span class="material">sal ammoniac</span> to it, and when you are about to cast, add a little bit of fine <span class="material">tin</span>. One must cast the <span class="material">copper</span> very hot into the mold, so that it is burning and very red, like <span class="material">gold</span>, <span class="material">silver</span>, <span class="material">latten</span>, and metal. You will know that it is hot enough when it is clear and shining like a newly polished steel mirror, or like melted silver. Protect it from wind so that it doesn't cool down too soon. Cover your cast with tow in order to prevent it from cooling down. <span class="material">Red copper</span> is cleaner than <span class="material">latten</span>, which smokes a lot, which prevents the metal from running. I have moulded it as a noyau very neatly, and as thin as a piece of paper. It must be very hot, white and shining like melted silver, or a mirror. I have moulded it as a noyau with the same sand mentioned above.

>  It takes more time to melt <span class="material">copper</span> and <span class="material">latten</span> than any other metals, even <span class="material">red copper</span>. It will run and will comes out well if you cast it very hot, and as thin as water.
