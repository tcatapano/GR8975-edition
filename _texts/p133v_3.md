## Various animals entwined

  <span class="activity"></span> 
 You can entwine a <span class="animal">snake</span> with a <span class="animal">lizard</span>, each one biting the other, or a <span class="animal">snake</span> eating a <span class="animal">frog</span>, or a <span class="animal">wall lizard</span> or something similar. But since these interlacings cannot be stripped, cut what's possible, and allow the rest to burn. To make the mouth of the <span class="animal">snake</span>, which must stand high, hold a <span class="animal">wall lizard</span>, which is small and would need to be held in the air, because the snake's head is higher, put under the wall <span class="animal">lizard</span> a mound of earth suitable to support it. And if you place the mold in a furnace, the animal drying quickly, it will quickly shrink, then it will burn more easily. These interlacings are also made to mask wounds or defects on the animal which happen when we catch them. Do not forget to join with <span class="material">wax</span>, applied carefully with a hot <span class="tool">iron wire</span>, all the parts of the animal which are one on top of the other, or those which are not well pressed on the slab of <span class="material">clay</span>, so that the soaked <span class="material">sand</span> does not remove them. Do that in order to

 avoid putting <span class="tool">pins</span> that should not be put, only on the top of the head, the thickest parts of the body, and on the delicate parts like the middle of the lizard's feet, the nails of which you will drive into the <span class="material">clay</span>, thus they won't move. Once your first mold is casted, peel away the belly of the animal, but do not forget to put some tenuous little pieces of <span class="material">wax</span> at the tip of the lizard's feet. But if it is from a <span class="animal">wall lizard</span>, lightly cover all the sole of its feet with wax, which will be removed with the second cast. A cavity is left which will be fill these little fingers with metal. then rework it. Make sure that <span class="material">wax</span> is fixed well on the parts of the animal which are one on top of the other, so that the soaked <span class="material">sand</span> which comes in does not make them move. If that happened your jacket of <span class="material">clay</span> would be spoiled and your mold wouldn't get the right thickness, would have holes, and would be spoiled. To obviate that you can make a thicker mold. If this occurs you could rework it in this fashion.
