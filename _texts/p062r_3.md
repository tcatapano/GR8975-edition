## Distant people and animals

 
First one roughs them out in <span class="color">gray</span> or in <span class="color">purple</span>, which is made of <span class="material">azure ash</span> and <span class="material">lake</span>. Once dry, one highlights and finishes with flesh tones and other colors and <span class="color">white</span>. And it will look better and is quicker to do than in <span class="color">black</span> and <span class="color">white</span>. Armies are painted the same way.
