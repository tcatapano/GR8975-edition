## Birds

> Those that are caught at <span class="time">Michaelmas</span> are good to keep, but those that are caught in <span class="time">March</span> die, because they are starting to fall in love. Ortolans are fed oats all summer so that they eat without getting fat, to be more suitable for hunting and helping to catch others. Then, when one wants to fatten them to sell, one gives them millet. They sing at night. They must be caught after mid—July and before Michaelmas, because after the period when they have their young in this country, they leave as turtledoves do. Siskins should also be caught after <span class="time">All Saints' Day</span> and before <span class="time">Christmas</span>, because afterwards they leave for the mountains to brood.
