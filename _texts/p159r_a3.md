## Fish glue

 
Beat it very finely and thinly on a <span class="tool">wellâ€”cleaned anvil</span>, then dilute your <span class="material">glue</span> with <span class="material">spirits</span>, put the mixture on <span class="tool">hot ashes</span>, and on a <span class="tool">low fire</span>, it will melt very soon. If the <span class="material">glue</span> is not strong and thick enough, add <span class="material">spirits</span> in greater quantity. Do not melt it in a fatty pot, but in a new pot if possible. It melts on fire and dries very quickly on fire. When your <span class="material">glue</span> sets on the work, heat it away from fire, it will stick very strongly. One reworks <span class="material">flowers</span> and delicate things made from <span class="material">silver</span>, <span class="material">gold</span>, <span class="material">tin</span> and other <span class="material">metal</span> with this glue which will not spoil your work.
