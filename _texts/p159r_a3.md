## Fish glue

 
Beat it very finely and thinly on a wellâ€”cleaned anvil, then dilute your glue with spirits, put the mixture on hot ashes, and on a low fire, it will melt very soon. If the glue is not strong and thick enough, add spirits in greater quantity. Do not melt it in a fatty pot, but in a new pot if possible. It melts on fire and dries very quickly on fire. When your glue sets on the work, heat it away from fire, it will stick very strongly. One reworks flowers and delicate things made from silver, gold, tin and other metal with this glue which will not spoil your work.
