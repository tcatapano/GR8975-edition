## Molding

 
> *position: top*

> If you want to quickly mold in demi—relief anything you come upon, fold some <span class="material">paper</span> five or six times over, and place it on the <span class="material">medal</span> and make sure the paper is folded around the edges of the medal so it is very secure. Next take a <span class="material">stick</span>, broad at one end and with a well—dulled point at the other, and rub firmly on the paper, and retrace the lines with the point of the stick until you reckon that your impression is well done. Then, at your convenience, rub oil onto the paper lightly with a <span class="tool">brush</span>, and cast some <span class="material">tallow</span> or <span class="material">wax</span> or <span class="material">sulphur</span> into it. And the paper, without burning, will give you a neat design that you can then mold in <span class="material">plaster</span> or <span class="material">tripoli</span> and then in <span class="material">lead</span> and other metals.
