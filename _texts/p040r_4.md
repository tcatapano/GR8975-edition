## Silver gilt buttons

 
Because <span class="material">silver gilt</span> does not fear fire, it is cut into lozenges flat[illegible] on one side, then they are joined together in a star shape with a paste of <span class="material">crushed enamel</span>, which is then melted & the enamel is gilt with <span class="material">gold leaf</span> and then reheated.
