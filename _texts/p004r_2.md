## To remove varnish from an old panel painting that has yellowed and varnish it again

 
 <span class="activity"></span> <span class="activity"></span> Take some <span class="material_format">white <span class="material">soap</span></span> and <span class="material">ashes</span> strained through a <span class="tool">sieve</span>, and soak all together in <span class="material">water</span>. And with a <span class="tool">sponge</span>, take some of the said <span class="material">ashes</span> and <span class="material">soap</span> and rub the painting with it. And when you see that the old varnish has been taken off, throw a <span class="unit">bucket</span> of <span class="material">water</span> at the painting to clean it, then leave it for a <span class="time">quarter of an hour</span> in the <span class="tool">sun</span> to dry and revive the colors. Once your painting is dried, you can apply your <span class="material_format"><span class="material">turpentine</span> varnish</span>.
