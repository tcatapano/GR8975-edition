## Medicine of orientals against all maladies

 <span class="figure"></span> 
 Dry some <span class="material">rosemary</span> in the month of May, then fill this <span class="tool">bowl</span> with powder made of it, and place a lit <span class="material">charcoal</span> on top. And, receive the smoke by a quite tightened mouth having closed your mouth well, and a part will come out by your nose. But if you want to purge the head also pinch the nose. Against colds, rheums, and other maladies.
