## Fountains

 <span class="figure"></span> 
If you wish to raise <span class="material">water</span> higher than its source, make a <span class="material">pipe</span> descend as in A. to B. to give it push , then from B. to C. make the <span class="material">pipe</span> ascend, but not quite to the height of the source, here represented by the dotted line, and then make it descend again in a <span class="material">pipe</span> from C. to D., and then let it rise higher than the line demarcating the height of the source, and do this successively until you reach the desired height. Remark nonetheless that the length of the descending pipe is always twice as long as the ascending <span class="material">pipe</span>. This cone also fills itself and demonstrates a perpetual fountain which you can adapt into a rock, attracting the water with which it is filled by the tip here marked, by sucking and breathing in. You can also make a watering can pipe in this way, so long as the bent pipe is just as long as the straight pipe, but does not extend as far down.
