## For <span class="material_format"><span class="material">earth</span> walls</span> and rustic construction

 
<span class="animal">Swallows</span> have taught us this craft by building their nests out of <span class="material">mud</span> mingled with wisps and bits of <span class="material"><span class="plant">hay</span></span> or <span class="material"><span class="plant">straw</span></span> to make it bond. Therefore, in places where <span class="material">stones</span> and <span class="material">bricks</span> are lacking, one can use <span class="material">earth</span> to make walls thin and thick. The best for this is <span class="material_format">light <span class="material">earth</span></span>, which does not form clumps when plowed, or better, that which in some way mingled with <span class="material">arene</span>, because it can be most easily beaten and tamped down. It is true that it needs to be dampened and cut into clumps with a <span class="tool">ditch—spade</span>, and put and placed in this <span class="tool">form</span>. This one lasts more and does not require that much effort, and dryness doesn't make it split or crack. However, since such kinds of <span class="material">earth</span> are not found everywhere, those who live on good and fertile land, after drawing the width and length of their foundations with a <span class="tool">rope</span>, drive in <span class="tool">long poles and rafters</span> along the edges on each side to support <span class="tool">boards</span> between which they throw the <span class="material">earth</span>, making each layer about <span class="unit">one foot</span> thick, interspersed with <span class="material_format">S.S.S—shaped branches of <span class="material"><span class="plant">heather</span></span></span> or similar things, then they tamp it down and beat it with <span class="tool">beaters of three different forms</span>. One is called the <span class="tool">mall</span>, which has a triangular form like A, and this is used firstly to tamp down the <span class="material">earth</span>. Then one uses another made of <span class="tool">pointed <span class="material">woodblocks</span> fitted onto a thick stick</span>, and this one is used to properly press the <span class="material">earth</span> at the wall’s ends and edges where they adhere to the <span class="tool">boards</span>, and is called [blank]. The other one is called the <span class="tool">bat</span> and is used to flatten and beat the <span class="material">earth</span> for the last time, as shown in C. Then one makes another layer of <span class="material">earth</span> and <span class="material"><span class="plant">heather</span></span> and beats as has been said, and continues thus until completing the wall, which is covered with <span class="material"><span class="plant">heather</span></span> and then with <span class="material">earth</span>. Some intersperse the said wall with rows of <span class="material">bricks</span>. They also make walls with a sloped foot, adding width to the foundations according to how high they want to build the wall. When it is old it <span class="color">white</span>ns, showing that it has <span class="material">saltpeter</span> in it. Which is why, when they fall down, <span class="profession">gunpowder</span> makers profit from them.
