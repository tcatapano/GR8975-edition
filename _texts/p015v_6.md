## Toothache

 
Some put <span class="material_format">a clove of <span class="material">garlic</span></span> in the ear on the side of the aching tooth, and after two or three hours they feel better. Others put in their nostril, on the same side as the tooth that hurts, some <span class="material_format"><span class="color">green</span> skin scraped from the stem of <span class="material"><span class="plant"><span class="foreign">bisaube</span></span></span></span>, namely that which is under the <span class="color">grey</span> one that looks like a <span class="plant">vine</span>.
