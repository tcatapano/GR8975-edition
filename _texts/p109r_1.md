## Working in rough with <span class="material">wax</span>

 
When the <span class="material">wax</span> is too hard, one mixes in some <span class="material">turpentine</span> or a bit of <span class="material">butter</span>, which renders the <span class="material">wax</span> malleable, and cleaner than <span class="material">tallow</span>, which the <span class="name">Italians</span> mix in, because oftentimes, it is necessary to put the <span class="tool">tools</span> into the mouth, <span class="tool">tools</span> which are better when made from <span class="material">box wood</span> or <span class="material">antler</span>.
