## Colors for <span class="material">gold</span>, or sauce

  <span class="activity"></span> 
 Take as much <span class="material">verdigris</span> as <span class="material">sal ammoniac</span>, & <span class="material">saltpetre</span> the size of a bean. Because if you put in too much, it would make the whole thing boil so much that it would all pour out. <span class="material">Saltpetre</span> is only put in to make it boil, so that you know when the material has boiled enough. This color put on sour melted gold makes it soft instantly.
