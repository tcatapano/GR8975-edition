## Making gold run for casting

 
Because <span class="material">gold</span> cools down very quickly, you have to give it a mixture when it is well melted that will keep the heat. <span class="material">Sublimate</span> softens it nicely. But, since it vanishes into <span class="material">smoke</span>, it won't aid you for very long. Therefore mix this mixture into it when you want to cast it: of <span class="material">sal ammoniac</span>, the best <span class="material">verdigris</span> that you can find, a bit of <span class="material">borax</span> and some <span class="material">saltpeter</span>. And this, held over the heat, will become neat. The <span class="material">saltpeter</span> makes it clear and heats it. But the key thing in this mixture is the <span class="material">verdigris</span>, which has to be good. This mixture softens your <span class="material">gold</span> so much that it becomes as tractable as <span class="material">lead</span>, even if it is good <span class="material">gold</span>.
  
For <span class="material">sand</span> for molding <span class="material">flowers</span> and <span class="material">leaves</span> & other delicate things, mix in <span class="material">raw plaster</span>, <span class="material">crushed brick</span> and <span class="material">stone alum</span>.
 
To moisten <span class="material">sand</span>, <span class="material">spirits</span> are excellent because it makes <span class="material">sand</span> fine and leaves in a vapor when you reheat your <span class="tool">box frame</span>.
 
<span class="material">Dilute sal ammoniac</span> is very good, is excellent for moistening <span class="material">sand</span>, but for lots of <span class="material">water</span> you only need a little bit of <span class="material">sal ammoniac</span>.
 
A raw lump of <span class="material">metal</span>, if you don't have <span class="material">crocum ferri</span>, is good for <span class="material">gold</span>.
 
The <span class="animal">snakes</span> and the <span class="animal">lizards</span> you wish to mold should not be kept for a long time, because if they are alive, they will waste away, and if they are dead, they will decay.
 
<span class="material">Plaster of Paris</span> is as hard as <span class="material">stone</span> and very good. When you want to choose some for your <span class="material">sand</span>, take the rawest and the hardest that is possible for you & that does not make any powder. Transparent <span class="material">[plaster]</span> and that which makes powder in giving way is that which is not good for this work. A sign of that which is near perfect is that it is hard & makes shining grains that look almost like <span class="material">sugar</span>. Finally, to mix it into the <span class="material">sand</span> to cast <span class="material">gold</span>, it has to be put in the fire twice, & reheated twice.

>  When <span class="material">gold</span> is really pure, it is so dry that it can just barely endure a <span class="tool">hammer</span>. But this mixture softens it like <span class="material">lead</span>.
