The proportion of a fowling piece is: 4 king's feet long and the bullet weights xviii pennyweights, the expulsion vi pennyweight of powder, its range iiii—by—xx pans and 3 and a half feet and two thumbs and around a line, which is the Paris aulne. The medium arquebuse, which is the usual one and the easiest, admits xv pennyweight of bullet, v pennyweight of powder & reaches lx paces.
