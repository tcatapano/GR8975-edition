## Portraits in Wax

 
If you do not mix your wax with any color dye, and if you paint some colors on the wax, these colors would fade if you cast it en noyau. But the representation is not damaged, rub it very lightly with spirits diluted with hot water. If your representations are varnished, repeat the molding process two or three times in order to remove this varnish which sticks to the mold. When the varnish is removed, your mold is very clean. If your representation is set on wood, it is necessary to pour very hot melted wax on the wood, otherwise the mold sticks to the wood. It is much better to mix your white wax with white lead than ceruse, because white lead is whiter and more firm.
