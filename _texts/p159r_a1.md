## Portraits in Wax

 
If you do not mix your wax with any <span class="material">color dye</span>, and if you paint some <span class="material">colors</span> on the <span class="material">wax</span>, these <span class="material">colors</span> would fade if you cast it en noyau. But the representation is not damaged, rub it very lightly with <span class="tool">spirits</span> diluted with hot <span class="tool">water</span>. If your representations are varnished, repeat the molding process two or three times in order to remove this varnish which sticks to the mold. When the <span class="material">varnish</span> is removed, your mold is very clean. If your representation is set on <span class="material">wood</span>, it is necessary to pour very hot <span class="material">melted wax</span> on the <span class="material">wood</span>, otherwise the mold sticks to the wood. It is much better to mix your white wax with <span class="material">white lead</span> than <span class="material">ceruse</span>, because <span class="material">white lead</span> is whiter and more firm.
