## Powder for hourglasses

 
  It must be made very fine and not subject to rust and with enough weight to flow. Taking i <span class="unit">lb.</span> of <span class="material">lead</span>, melt it and skim and purify it from its filth, then pour into it four <span class="unit">â„¥</span> of <span class="material_format">finely ground common <span class="material">salt</span></span>, and take care that there are no stones or earth. And immediately after pouring it, stir continuously very well with an <span class="tool">iron tool</span> until the <span class="material">lead</span> and <span class="material">salt</span> are quite incorporated, and take it immediately off the <span class="tool">fire</span>, stirring continuously. And if it seems too coarse, grind it on a <span class="tool"><span class="material_format"><span class="material">marble</span> slab</span></span> and pass it through a <span class="tool">fine sieve</span>, then wash it as many as times as necessary until the <span class="material">water</span> runs clear, throwing out the fine powder that will float on it, renewing the <span class="material">water</span> as many times as necessary until it is completely cleared.
