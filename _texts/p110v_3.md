## A cast of lead or tin

 
Because you want to cast <span class="material">tin</span> very thinly, if your <span class="material">medal</span>, <span class="material">plant</span> or other thing you want to mold is thin and fine, make sure to include more <span class="material">tin</span>, much more than <span class="material">lead</span>, namely less than the fourth part of <span class="material">lead</span> for three of <span class="material">tin</span>. And moreover, one only puts <span class="material">lead</span> in as an alloy. Contrarily, if you want to mold something strong and thick, put a lot more <span class="material">lead</span> in than <span class="material">tin</span>. And for the one and the other you can put in a little <span class="material">looking—glass tin</span>, but only a very little, with a little <span class="material">resin</span>, when you want to cast. Since then, when molding with pure new <span class="material">lead</span>, I put in two <span class="unit">ounces</span> of <span class="material">pure tin</span> for every <span class="unit">pound</span> of <span class="material">lead</span>. And when molding with <span class="material">pure tin</span>, I put in two <span class="unit">ounces</span> of <span class="material">pure lead</span> for every <span class="unit">pound</span> of <span class="material">tin</span>. I made some <span class="material">plants</span> and <span class="animal">snakes</span> as if they were real.
