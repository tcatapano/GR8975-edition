## Enamel

 
 Enamel takes more readily on copper than on silver. It is true that the cut needs to be well hollowed out & rough. Azure in body & the red called gules, white enamel & thick green take very well. Having enamelled, one gilds the feuillages of the cutting[illegible]. Copper has a similar hardness when cut as pure silver or pistolet gold.
