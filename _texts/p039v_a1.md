## Enamel

 
 <span class="material">Enamel</span> takes more readily on <span class="material">copper</span> than on <span class="material">silver</span>. It is true that the cut needs to be well hollowed out & rough. Azure in body & the red called gules, white enamel & thick green take very well. Having enamelled, one gilds the feuillages of the cutting[illegible]. Copper has a similar hardness when cut as pure <span class="material">silver</span> or <span class="material">pistolet</span> gold.
