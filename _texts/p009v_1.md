##  <span class="profession">Painters</span> 

 
 <span class="activity"></span>  They melt <span class="material">orpiment</span> entirely in a <span class="tool">glass bottle</span> on <span class="tool">very hot ashes</span>, but it would be more appropriate to sublimate <span class="material">orpiment</span> in a <span class="tool">longâ€”neck matrass</span> as for making garnets<span class="material"></span>. The <span class="material">orpiment</span> thus turns red like red <span class="material">enamel</span> and it has to be ground first in <span class="material">distemper</span>, because once entirely melted it is very brittle and difficult to grind. Then, once dry, you can thin it with <span class="material">oil</span> and it will make a deep and saturated yellow. But to prevent <span class="material">orpiment</span> from fading in contact with other colours and make it compatible with these and to make it dry quickly, a most rare secret is to calcine <span class="material_format">common <span class="material">salt</span></span> and to grind it together with the <span class="material">orpiment</span>. <span class="material">Green verditer</span> is not used with <span class="material">oil</span>.
