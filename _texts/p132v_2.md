## Crocum ferry

  <span class="activity"></span> 
 After I processed it with <span class="material">vinegar</span> and reddened under heat, I had it ground very finely on the <span class="material">porphyry</span>, until there could be no ruggedness felt under the nails. Then I soaked it in very good <span class="material">vinegar</span> for 2 or 3 days, stirring the mixture several times a day. Then I boiled it and made it red—hot in a <span class="tool">pot</span>, and put the whole thing into an air furnace. I obtained a mass full of eyes, but that crumbled finely between the fingers. I mixed half as much as <span class="material">stone alum</span> in the sand. I diluted the sand very thinly, and molded a very small <span class="animal">lizard</span>, which molded very cleanly and finely. <span class="material">Crocum ferry</span> does not make the mold harder, but makes it firmer. When your mold is soft and fat under your nail, it means that the <span class="material">crocum</span> is good, very fine and well prepared. You can add any quantity of crocum, your mold will not be damaged because it is a friend of <span class="material">gold</span>. I think it would be the same with <span class="material">silver</span>. And in order that molds made with it do not crack, make it with <span class="material">needle filings</span>.

> You can add this <span class="material">sand</span> to the molds you want to use to cast <span class="material">silver</span>, because it make molds firmer, and when you scratch it, you will find it a bit rougher than the other molds not made from this <span class="material">sand</span>. You mold very clean with this <span class="material">sand</span>.

> You can use this one for all molds, because it prevents them from cracking and bursting when heated. This <span class="material">sand</span> withstands several casts for molding flat medals. <span class="material">Sand</span> from <span class="material">steel</span> or <span class="material">needle filings</span> is redder and better.
