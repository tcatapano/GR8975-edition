## Common medals

 
<span class="material">Relief awls</span> are made of <span class="material">untempered steel</span>, and then it is tempered. With it we beat on a <span class="tool">matrice</span>, not red hot on the fire as some people think, but on some <span class="tool">steeled iron</span>, reheated and adoulcy, that is then tempered.
