## Perfect amalgam

 
 <span class="activity"></span> Take the <span class="tool"><span class="material_format">finest <span class="material">sandstone</span></span></span> you can find and make a cavity in the middle. And put in it <span class="unit">an eighth part</span> of <span class="material">☿</span> and rub it and wear it down while adding some <span class="material">water</span> with <span class="material">☾</span> or <span class="material">☼</span> until the material becomes paste—like and even harder. Then, if you want, corrode it with <span class="material_format">good <span class="material"><span class="foreign">aqua fortis</span></span></span>, if it is <span class="material">☾</span> or <span class="material">♀</span>. Then melt it again, having taken it out as you know. The <span class="material">☾</span> will have some color, and after being melted it will leave some flecks of <span class="material">☼</span>, and the <span class="material">♀</span> will be very fine and will have almost no covering.
