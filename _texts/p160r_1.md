## Presses for large moulds

 figure identifier="fig_p160r_1" url="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9—oNrvWdlO5ZDNJT25PWjlUbGM"/> <span class="figure"></span> It is made of two sheets of <span class="material">iron</span>, fasten with four small <span class="material">iron pillars</span>, in such a way that the upper sheet is able to move and run freely along the pillars, while the lower one is fixed. A <span class="material">St André cross</span>, made of <span class="material">iron</span>, stops at the end of the pillars; there is a screw in the middle of the cross, which squeezes the sheets against the molds placed between them. For <span class="material">small molds</span>, we make a <span class="material">frame</span>; having put the mold between two metal sheets, we squeeze it in the frame with for small moulds, put the mould between two iron sheets, and squeeze it with <span class="tool">wedges</span>. <span class="tool">Big wooden presses</span>, with a <span class="tool">screw</span>, apart from being heavy to move to the furnace for casting, make it difficult to see when they squeeze too much, and they often break the molds. The <span class="tool">screw</span> is fixed to these <span class="tool">nuts</span> which are nailed down the upper plate, this way it raises and presses the mould.
