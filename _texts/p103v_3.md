## To make colors fluid

 
<span class="activity"></span>Mix some <span class="material">vinegar</span> with a bit of <span class="material">bile</span>, put it into a <span class="tool"><span class="material">glass</span> bottle</span>, and if you want to preserve it for a long time, add some <span class="material">salt</span> and mix some of this with your colors which will make them flow.
