## Catching nightingales

 
 See the 15th folio after this. 
 
<span class="activity"></span> In order to catch them, you must observe them in real life, the food that they favor and their mating season. The <span class="animal">nightingale</span>, as long as he is singing, marks his own territory. Therefore approach him by pretending to look for something on the ground. Take some <span class="animal">worms</span> from <span class="material">old flour</span> or from beneath what you are kneading or from mills, which <span class="animal">nightingales</span> love, and put some on your hat, fastened with a pin or in any other way, so that it can wiggle. And five or six steps away from the hedge where it is singing, dig a hole, and place some <span class="animal">worms</span> in it, as well as your device made out of little criss—crossed sticks. As soon as you leave it will be anxious to go and see what you have done. And seeing <span class="animal">worms</span> it will enter.
