## <span class="profession">Iron engravers</span>' varnish

 
 <span class="activity"></span> <span class="activity"></span> Take <span class="material">linseed oil</span> or <span class="material">walnut oil</span> and instead of <span class="material">black pitch</span> you will add some <span class="material_format"><span class="material">pine</span> resin</span> and you must cook it like black varnish on <span class="tool">fire</span>. And to apply it, heat your <span class="material">iron</span> and apply just one layer of varnish, and when it no longer smokes, it is dry. Then engrave with a <span class="tool">steel point</span> whatever you want. Then take some <span class="material">salt</span> and <span class="material">verdigris</span> and soak it with <span class="unit">as much of one as of the other</span> in <span class="material_format">very strong <span class="material">vinegar</span></span>, and leave it for <span class="time">XX4 hours</span> before using it, and the whole will be soaked. Then spread this liqueur or sauce on the engraved object with a <span class="tool">sponge</span>

  or <span class="tool">linen cloth</span> and leave it thus for <span class="time">xx4 hours</span> and it will be engraved. But if you should want to engrave it quickly, varnish all your work and boil it in the aforementioned liquor, and this will engrave it quickly.
