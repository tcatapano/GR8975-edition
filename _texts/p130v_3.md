## For molding thinly 

 
 After you have molded the first mold as the core, leave it to dry well before removing the figure from wax, so that the mold is not ruined. Afterwards, then make make a small lasagna of paste as thick as you like, and, once you have greased the cavity of your first hollowed mold with butter, apply the paste to it [the cavity of the first concave mold] and then the upper part of the second mold. If you grease [the mold] with oil, it will be soaked up [into the mold] and it will not be as clean as butter.
