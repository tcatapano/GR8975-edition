## Infusion of <span class="material"><span class="plant">anthos</span></span> or <span class="material"><span class="plant">rosemary</span></span>

 
<span class="activity"></span>It is better to cook the <span class="material"><span class="plant">flower</span></span> in <span class="time">August</span> and more suited to <span class="material">oil</span>â€”making. Take as much as you want. Then put it into a <span class="tool">bottle</span> very well corked, and leave them to wilt in the shade for a <span class="time">day</span>. Then add the first substance of <span class="material">wine</span> and leave to settle three or four days; and express it all in another <span class="tool">vessel</span> and into this very same substance of <span class="material">wine</span>, add seven or eight infusions made out of new <span class="material"><span class="plant">flowers</span></span>. Then leave the latest infusion in the sun for a <span class="time">month</span>. Then distill it through a <span class="tool">still</span>. Then mix two <span class="unit">ounces</span> of this <span class="material">water</span> with two or three <span class="unit">spoons</span> of <span class="material">white wine</span>; but this is for the elderly. <span class="name">Paul the Third</span> used it.
