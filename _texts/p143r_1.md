## Moulding turtles and tortoises

  <span class="activity"></span> 
 The <span class="animal">turtle</span> the one that lives in water is more beautiful to mold because it has prettier scales and straight legs. And the <span class="animal">tortoises</span> have crooked ones. They eat a lot. To get ready to kill them, open their mouth and pass a long <span class="tool">penknife</span> through all the intestines. And then make it swallow some <span class="material">vinegar</span> mixed with <span class="material">spirits</span> or <span class="material">urine</span>, as one does for <span class="animal">snakes</span>. It is necessary to mould them in several pieces, and even the back sometimes because the sides of certain ones are narrower than others and in this instance do not release from the cast. To make them die, you must not boil them, because they come apart, even the shell, in the hot water. They the shells come out better when hollowed because their great thickness spoils the mold. <span class="animal">Turtles</span> are more lively. The <span class="animal">tortoises</span> are leaner, slower, and more sleepy. If you scratch <span class="animal">turtles</span> on their shells, no matter how sleepy they are, they move; <span class="animal">tortoises</span> do not.

>  They <span class="animal">turtles</span>/<span class="animal">tortoises</span> die rather quickly in <span class="material">vinegar</span> mixed with a little <span class="material">spirits</span> or <span class="material">urine</span>, as with all other animals.

>  They <span class="animal">turtles</span>/<span class="animal">tortoises</span> keep their eyes closed in the winter, and appear as dead, having been numbed by the cold. They hide in the earth or under balls of grain or warm manure, and survive only on the dampness of the earth.

>  You must not mold them too soon after they die because they are still stiff. But on the day after, you will be able to manipulate them and bend their legs as you wish.
