## To make gold fluid

  
Put as much <span class="material">verdigris</span> as <span class="material">sal ammoniac</span>, as much <span class="material">borax</span> as <span class="material">saltpetre</span>. But don't add a greater quantity of <span class="material">borax</span> and <span class="material">saltpetre</span> than half the quantity of <span class="material">verdegris</span> and <span class="material">sal ammoniac</span>, in fact add as much <span class="material">borax</span> and <span class="material">saltpetre</span> all together as <span class="material">verdigris</span>. Grind into powder the ingredients on the <span class="tool">marble slab</span>, then grind again with very good <span class="material">vinegar</span> until it is very fine, like a ground color, grind <span class="material">verdigris</span> with <span class="material">oil</span>, then leave to dry if you have time, if you haven't so much time dry it with the fire of the forge, make so that it is very dry.
