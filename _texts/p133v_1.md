## Porosity and little holes which are in the mold 

  <span class="activity"></span> 
 It oftens happens when you cast two or three molds one after the other using the same <span class="tool">dish</span>, because the last casting comes from the bottom of the <span class="tool">dish</span> and is thicker, and then often the last cast which comes from the bottom and which is the thickest of the <span class="tool">dish</span>, may easily become porous. Cast thinner and neater, as long as you blow very strongly on the soaked <span class="material">sand</span> while casting in order to clear the little air bubbles.
