## Damask Cloth

 
You can make damask cloth of two different colours and imitate embroidery without adding anything else to it, as follows. Once it is is dyed <span class="color">yellow</span>, pounce onto it such a pattern as will please you. Then you will sew some <span class="tool">string or a bigger cord</span> loosely onto the pattern and throw it into a dye of <span class="material">woad</span> or <span class="material">pastel</span> and it will become <span class="color">green</span>, except that which is beneath the <span class="tool">string</span>, which will remain <span class="color">yellow</span> because the <span class="color">green</span> dye will not have penetrated there. And you can do the same with other colours and, instead of <span class="tool">string or cord</span>, add some <span class="tool">pieces of poor quality cloth cut in <span class="name">Moorish</span> shapes</span> on top of the first colour. In that manner, you will have cheap embroidery.
