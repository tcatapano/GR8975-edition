##  For cages 

 
 <span class="activity"></span> <span class="activity"></span> You can embellish them with thin <span class="material_format"><span class="material">enamel</span> canes</span> of various colors by covering the <span class="material">yellow latten</span> or <span class="material_format"><span class="material">iron</span> wire</span> with said canes. These you will break neatly into the length that you want if you make a small notch with a <span class="tool">cutting file</span> at the point where you want to break them, and they will not break anywhere else. You can bend them with a <span class="tool"><span class="material">wooden</span> model</span> over a <span class="tool">brazier</span> or by the <span class="tool">heat</span> of a <span class="tool">lamp</span>. A <span class="material_format">cane</span> can be stretched out as long as you want in a small <span class="tool">furnace</span> made like a reverberatory oven but with openings on both sides. And once the large <span class="material_format">cane</span> is red, they seize the hot end of it with small <span class="tool"><span class="tool">pincers</span> that have long beaks</span>, with one end of the beak inside the end of the <span class="material_format">cane</span>, so that it may be stretched without becoming blocked. The other end of the <span class="material_format">cane</span> is held with the <span class="tool">hand</span>, as it is not hot. Once the <span class="material_format">cane</span> is stretched enough, the one who is working seated with his <span class="tool">stove</span>, <span class="unit">the size of a carnation pot</span>, placed in front of him, breaks it off and carries on. This is for making <span class="material_format">cane</span> for capes, which may be cut, as already mentioned, with a <span class="tool">file</span>. <span class="profession">Glass—button makers</span> also use the said <span class="tool">stove</span>.
