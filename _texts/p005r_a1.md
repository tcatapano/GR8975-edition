## <span class="material">Steel</span> mirrors

 
 <span class="activity"></span> <span class="activity"></span> \+ They are called <span class="material">steel</span> mirrors because in the past they were usually made of <span class="material">steel</span> polished with <span class="material_format"><span class="material">emery</span> paste</span>. But more easily, various kinds are made of <span class="material"><span class="foreign">cuivre franc</span></span>, which is <span class="material">rosette</span> and <span class="material">tin</span>, because these can be cast in a <span class="tool">mold</span> and made round, hollow, convex or in whatever various shapes you want to represent. 
 
 So take <span class="unit">half</span> <span class="material">rosette copper</span> and <span class="unit">half</span> <span class="material_format">soft <span class="material">tin</span></span>, i.e. fine and yet unused. Place them in a <span class="tool">crucible</span>, and first melt the <span class="material">copper</span>. Once it has been well melted, add the <span class="material">tin</span> and mix them together and cast that in a <span class="tool">white stone mold with no hole</span>, and grease the <span class="tool">mold</span>, which should be moderately warm, with <span class="material">oil</span>. Then, once your mirror has been molded, you can polish it in this manner. 
 
 Set one mirror in <span class="tool"><span class="material">plaster</span></span> to hold it firmly, then put the other one over it with <span class="material_format">fine <span class="material">sand</span></span> between them, and rub one against the other, whether they are hollowed or flat, and thus you will polish both at once. If you want to polish them on both sides, you only have to switch them, which means putting the one that was polishing in the <span class="tool"><span class="material">plaster</span></span> and [using] the one which was in the <span class="tool"><span class="material">plaster</span></span> to polish. Once they have been polished with you can soften them with <span class="material">tripoli of <span class="place">Venice</span></span> that should not be sandy, and then with <span class="material">paste</span>. You use <span class="material">water</span> with <span class="material"><span class="foreign">arene</span></span> to polish, but polishing with <span class="material">tripoli</span> and <span class="material">paste</span> is done dry. Once the mirror has been polished, you can set it.
