## Candle smoke

 
It allows the piece to be taken out more easily, and even if it is slightly thick, it does not stick because it has no substance. I have perfumed my <span class="material">core molds</span> this way for <span class="material">tin</span> and <span class="material">lead</span>, and I have casted in a <span class="material">cold mold</span>, but drying it well beforehand, and the piece came out quite cleanly. It is true that lead mixed with half the quantity of tin, because the medal was very thick, was very hot.
