## To relieve the pain of g{out}

 
 <span class="activity"></span>  Take <span class="unit">half a pound</span> of <span class="material_format">finely powdered golden and yellow <span class="material">marcasite</span></span>, <span class="unit">half an ounce</span> of <span class="material">storax</span>, <span class="unit">4 lb.</span> of <span class="material">urine</span>, incorporate well together, little by little, in a <span class="tool">mortar</span>, then boil all together quite strongly. But the <span class="tool">pot</span> needs to be well <span class="tool">cover</span>ed so the smoke does not escape. Then distill the <span class="material_format">imbibed <span class="material">urine</span></span>, separated by inclination, in an <span class="tool">alembic</span>, well luted and covered with a <span class="tool"><span class="material">copper</span> head</span>. And soak a <span class="tool">cloth</span> with the <span class="material">said water</span> and apply it lukewarm on the pain.
