## To make varnish

 
Take one pound of <span class="material">linseed oil</span>, and then put it in a pot of earth mixed with a <span class="material">breadcrust</span> and three <span class="material">onions</span>, and put it on a charcoal fire, and you will cook it on a low fire, and let it boil for the space of five hours. You will take half an ounce of <span class="material">flour glue</span>, and will make it boil just as before, and stir continuously with a <span class="tool">spoon</span>. And then afterwards, you will add two ounces of wellâ€”pounded <span class="material">sandarac</span> to it, and will do so as above. And then afterwards, you will take <span class="material">mastic</span> and <span class="material">gum arabic</span>, two ounces of each, both well pounded, and will put everything together, and will have it boil, always stirring, for the space of five hours. And then you will add <span class="material">rock alum</span>, two ounces, and then you will make it boil.

fire until it is cooked enough. And strain it through a <span class="tool">cloth</span> that is compact enough. And when you have strained it, leave it to cool a little. And if you see that it is so thick that you cannot strain it, you will add a little of that oil and will make it better.
