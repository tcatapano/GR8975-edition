##  To color stamped ornaments for trunks 

 
   <span class="activity"></span> <span class="activity"></span> The stamped ornament made from <span class="material_format">sheets of <span class="material">copper</span> or <span class="material">latten</span></span> are made with <span class="material_format"><span class="material">wood</span> from a service tree engraved and cut</span>, should you want to spend less. Next, the stamped piece is colored with the aforesaid <span class="material">lacquer</span> colours of lacquer, verdet, blue enamel, and soaked in <span class="material">turpentine varnish</span>. But wherever you want to make it azure, apply some <span class="material"><span class="foreign">fer blanc</span></span>, which is more appropriate for an azure background.
