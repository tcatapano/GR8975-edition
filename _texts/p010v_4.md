## For whitening <span class="material">ceruse</span>

 
  Hardâ€”boil some <span class="material">eggs</span>, cut them in half and take the <span class="material">yolks</span> out, and between the two halves of the <span class="material">white</span> put a bit of <span class="material">ceruse</span>, and tie the two halves together with <span class="tool"><span class="material">thread</span></span>. Then boil in <span class="material_format">clear <span class="material">water</span></span>, and it will become black, and thus the <span class="material">ceruse</span> will be purified. Some reheat it over <span class="tool">fire</span> and it becomes very white.
