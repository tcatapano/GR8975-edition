## Goldsmith

 
 They bind <span class="material">silver filings</span> with <span class="material">saltpeter</span> which refines it & does not make it brittle. But <span class="material">gold filings</span> are bound with <span class="material">borax</span> or, to save the borax, with <span class="material">lead</span>, which refines the gold & softens it, for the saltpeter would make it brittle, which it does not do to silver. This is why, in order to save, goldsmiths use it to bind it in order to save borax, which costs viii sols per ounce & saltpeter costs x sols per lb. When goldsmiths have thus bound their silver filings with salpeter, a red enamel vitrifies at the bottom of the crucible. I do not know if the <span class="material">copper</span> mixed in with the silver is the cause for this. Try for enamel.
