## White varnish on plaster

 
Put down two or three layers of white glue for painting. Afterwards, varnish with varnish of sandarac, aspic oil, and a bit of mastic. Put it into a vessel at night, everything ground well together without fire, which would make it turn yellow. Then, with a paintbrush, it becomes dry immediately. Filter the oil that will have absorbed the substance.
