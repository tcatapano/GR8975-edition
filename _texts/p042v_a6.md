## White varnish on plaster

 
Put down two or three layers of <span class="material">white glue</span> for painting. Afterwards, varnish with <span class="material">varnish of sandarac</span>, <span class="material">aspic oil</span>, and a bit of <span class="material">mastic</span>. Put it into a <span class="tool">vessel</span> at night, everything ground well together without fire, which would make it turn yellow. Then, with a <span class="tool">paintbrush</span>, it becomes dry immediately. Filter the oil that will have absorbed the substance.
