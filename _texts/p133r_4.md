## Clamps and the broken mold

  <span class="activity"></span> 
 When you have done the first firing and taken off the <span class="tool">clamps</span> and you have opened your mold to clean it by taking off the bubbles with <span class="material">quicksilver</span> which one cannot do with closed molds, reclose the mold and reattach the <span class="tool">clamps</span> but not in the same place as the first time. Reapply lute and dry it but if this is for casting <span class="material">silver</span> or <span class="material">gold</span> [use] lute with the rest of <span class="material">sand</span> which has been used because this is the best netting. If your mold is broken in refiring you can augment it with <span class="tool">clamps</span> and lute.
