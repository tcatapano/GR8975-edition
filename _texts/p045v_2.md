## How to adjust a bent gun barrel

 
Take off the <span class="tool">breech</span> and put it [the barrel] on a wellâ€”leveled <span class="tool">table</span> set perpendicular to the floor, and insert a very smooth <span class="tool">string</span> without knots, on each end of which there is a plumb hanging from each side. Then look in the barrel along the string, and if it does not touch equally all over, note the place where it does not touch and hit it with a <span class="tool">hammer</span> on the exterior of this this side in the same place, and this will make it straight. Do this all around it.
