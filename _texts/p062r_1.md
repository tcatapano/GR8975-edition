## Perspectives

 
Painting perspectives in oil takes a long time because of the many lines that need to be drawn with a <span class="tool">ruler</span>, and for that reason one generally paints them in <span class="material">distemper</span>. One chooses the vanishing points at will. The main thing is to know where the point is. One commonly sets two or three, sometimes up to five.
