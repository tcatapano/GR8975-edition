## Molding grasshoppers and things too thin

  
 If you have to mold a piece of written—on paper that is too thin, after you have done the first cast and it has set, give a little thickness to the reverse of your paper with <span class="material">melted butter</span>, which is the most appropriate means there is, & for strengthening the wings of either a <span class="animal">butterfly</span> or a <span class="animal">grasshopper</span>, or any delicate part of an animal to which you need to give thickness. But take heed to apply this melted butter under the wing or in whichever place it will not be seen. For giving thickness to a <span class="plant">pansy</span> or other flowers, <span class="material">butter</span> is not good, but rather <span class="material">wheat oil</span>, which is soon dry & holds firm. <span class="material">Wax</span> would not be appropriate here for it is too hot once melted, and it makes the thing to which it is applied contract. But butter is amiable and handleable.

Write therefore with <span class="material">cinnabar mixed with oil</span>, on oiled & stamped (?) paper.
