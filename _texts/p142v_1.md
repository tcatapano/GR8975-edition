## Molding grasshoppers and things too thin

  <span class="activity"></span> <span class="activity"></span> <span class="activity"></span>  
 If you have to mold a piece of written—on paper that is too thin, after you have done the first cast and it has set, give a little thickness to the reverse of your paper with <span class="material">melted butter</span>, which is the most appropriate means there is, & for strengthening the wings of either a <span class="animal">butterfly</span> or a <span class="animal">grasshopper</span>, or any delicate part of an animal to which you need to give thickness. But take heed to apply this melted <span class="material">butter</span> under the wing or in whichever place it will not be seen. For giving thickness to a <span class="plant">pansy</span> or other flowers, <span class="material">butter</span> is not good, but rather <span class="material">wheat oil</span>, which is soon dry & holds firm. <span class="material">Wax</span> would not be appropriate here for it is too hot once melted, and it makes the thing to which it is applied contract. But butter is amiable and handleable.

> If you write on <span class="material">paper</span> or on common <span class="material">carton</span> and your letters are made with <span class="material">gum</span>, the moisture of the <span class="tool">clay plate</span> (?) or the wet (?) <span class="material">sand</span> for a <span class="material">noyau</span> will moisten your letters and undo them. Write therefore with <span class="material">cinnabar</span> mixed with <span class="material">oil</span>, on oiled & stamped (?) <span class="material">paper</span>.
