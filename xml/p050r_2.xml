    <heading>Molding</heading>

    <block position="top">If you want to quickly mold in demi-relief anything you come upon, fold some <material>paper</material> five or six times over,
    and place it on the <material>medal</material> and make sure the paper is folded around the edges of the medal so it is very secure.
    Next take a <material>stick</material>, broad at one end and with a well-dulled point at the other, and rub firmly on the paper, and
    retrace the lines with the point of the stick until you reckon that your impression is well done. Then, at your convenience, rub oil
    onto the paper lightly with a <tool>brush</tool>, and cast some <material>tallow</material> or <material>wax</material> or
    <material>sulphur</material> into it. And the paper, without burning, will give you a neat design that you can then mold in
    <material>plaster</material> or <material>tripoli</material> and then in <material>lead</material> and other metals.</block>
