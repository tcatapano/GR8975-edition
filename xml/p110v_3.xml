<heading>A cast of lead or tin</heading>

<block purpose="making">Because you want to cast <material>tin</material> very thinly, if your <material>medal</material>, <material>plant</material> or other thing you want to mold is thin and fine, make sure to include more <material>tin</material>, much more than <material>lead</material>, namely less than the fourth part of <material>lead</material> for three of <material>tin</material>. And moreover, one only puts <material>lead</material> in as an alloy. Contrarily, if you want to mold something strong and thick, put a lot more <material>lead</material> in than <material>tin</material>. And for the one and the other you can put in a little <material>looking-glass tin</material>, but only a very little, with a little <material>resin</material>, when you want to cast.  Since then, when molding with pure new <material>lead</material>, I put in two <unit>ounces</unit> of <material>pure tin</material> for every <unit>pound</unit> of <material>lead</material>.  And when molding with <material>pure tin</material>, I put in two <unit>ounces</unit> of <material>pure lead</material> for every <unit>pound</unit> of <material>tin</material>. I made some <material>plants</material> and <animal>snakes</animal> as if they were real.</block>

I cast <material>tin</material> when it was nearly red, and the same thing with <material>lead</material>, which however had not remained in the fire for too long, because it becomes brittle and burns up.
