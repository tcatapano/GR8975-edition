    <heading>Damask Cloth</heading>

    <block>You can make damask cloth of two different colours and imitate embroidery without adding
        anything else to it, as follows. Once it is is dyed <color>yellow</color>, pounce onto it
        such a pattern as will please you. Then you will sew some <tool>string or a bigger
            cord</tool> loosely onto the pattern and throw it into a dye of
            <material>woad</material> or <material>pastel</material> and it will become
            <color>green</color>, except that which is beneath the <tool>string</tool>, which will
        remain <color>yellow</color> because the <color>green</color> dye will not have penetrated
        there. And you can do the same with other colours and, instead of <tool>string or
            cord</tool>, add some <tool>pieces of poor quality cloth cut in <name type="group"
                >Moorish</name> shapes</tool> on top of the first colour. In that manner, you will
        have cheap embroidery.</block>
