    <heading>Excellent burn relief</heading>

    <block><activity type="medicine"/>Heat <material>linseed oil</material> on a light fire, without letting it boil and simmer. But when it is hot put a quarter part(of the quantity of the <material>linseed oil</material>) of the newest <material>wax</material> you can find. Once it has melted, let it cool and when it begins to curdle, stir it continuously with a new <tool>wooden spatula</tool> for the length of time it takes to say 9 <foreign language="Latin"><time>pater nosters</time></foreign>, and while you say them, wash this composition with <material>holy water</material>, always stirring. Having said the first of 9 <foreign language="Latin"><time>pater nosters</time></foreign>, pour the first <material>water</material> out and add more, then wash and stir the composition for the time it takes to say 8 <foreign language="Latin"><time>pater nosters</time></foreign>. In the interval it takes to say 3 of the 7 <foreign language="Latin"><time>pater nosters</time></foreign>, and continuing thusly, add more <material>water</material>, as above, until there is only one last new <foreign language="Latin"><time>pater noster</time></foreign> left. Then you will have a soft <color>white</color> <material>ointment</material>, with which you will apply to the burn for 9 <time>days</time>. But don't apply any more, you must let the flesh grow over. Dress it twice a <time>day</time> and each time you wash your face with <material>water</material>, and mix it together a bit tepidly, without rubbing. But press it with <tool>wet linen</tool>, and wipe it similarly with <tool>fine linen</tool>, and apply the <material>ointment</material>. On which you can put <tool>binder's string</tool>. This will regrow your hair and prevent a scar from forming. A <material>powder</material> maker who was completely burnt but had no sign of burns taught it to me.</block>
