    <block> Spread a fine layer of imprinting <material>black wax</material> on the inside of the frame then coat it
        inside with <material>wheat oil</material>, then dust it with lamp smoke because this color should not be
        lustrous for fake stones. Having done this, set your stone with a piece of <material>wax</material> then, with a
        <tool>steel point</tool>, or a small <tool>finishing hammer</tool>, join the edge of the frame with the stone, so that
        light cannot get in but be careful not to hit the stone, which would break.</block>
