<heading><animal>Toad</animal></heading>

<block>If by chance you want to mold this ugly animal and if it should piss in your hand, it will sting your hand and cause it to itch, as if you had been holding nettles. But the very best remedy for this is to put your hand into <material>fresh dirt</material>, and to cover it as if you wanted to bury it. <animal>Frogs</animal> are not so beautiful when molded because they have shiny skin, and <animal>toads</animal> have lumpy skin.</block>

<block position="left-bottom"> You can mold the <animal>toad</animal> hollow, and leaving a notch open on the underbelly, you will make it jump with the twisted cord of the saw. If it is a small, put it on a <tool>magnet</tool> cut small to the size of the <animal>toad</animal>, then put it in good <material>vinegar</material>.</block>

<block position="right-middle"> If it is big, mold hollow, and if you want to mold it with its mouth open, put some <material>cotton</material> therein, and then put some melted <material>wax</material> on the <material>cotton</material>.</block>
