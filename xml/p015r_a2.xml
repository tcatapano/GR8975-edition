    <heading>Casting <material>metal</material>s</heading>

    <block>Candlesticks and small works are cast in a <tool>frame</tool> with
            <material>sand</material>. Having stamped the work, sprinkle it with
            <material>flour</material> in order to make the <material>copper</material> or
            <material>latten</material> run better. When the <material>sand</material> has been in
        use for one month, it is necessary to take some new <material>sand</material> because that
        which has been used, being reheated +, dries &amp; loses its binding power. Yet it is used
        mixed with the new <material>sand</material>, because it makes the work less porous. Large
        works such as artillery, bells and similar things are cast in <material>earth</material>,
        and <material>copper</material> cast in <material>earth</material> makes less crust and is
            <color>white</color>r than when cast in <material>sand</material>. The
            <material>earth</material> is <material_format>sandy
            <material>clay</material></material_format> mixed with <material><animal>horse</animal>
            dung</material> and <material_format><material>cloth</material> waste</material_format>.
        The <material>earth</material> that has been used for casting, which is
        <color>black</color>, baked and as if burnt, is mixed with <material_format>artificial
                <material>sand</material></material_format>, and is very good. For softening and
        making the <material>copper</material> run, once it is melted, one throws in some
            <material>lead</material>, which does not form an alloy but is found on the surface of
        the cast.</block>
