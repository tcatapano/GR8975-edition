<heading>Azure enamel with oil</heading>

<block purpose="making">One must choose the finest possible, for if it is coarse one cannot work in oil. And if you cannot find any that is fine enough, you may as well grind it, not with <material>water</material> but with <material>oil</material>, and grind it thick. Then lay it on your palette and mix in some <material>turpentine</material> but not much, to make it bind, and make it as thick as butter or mortar, and then, with a large enough <tool>brush</tool>, work it while always moving the brush freely. Then, to soften it, make jagged hatching movements with the tip of the brush. The highlights will be made using the same diluted with <material>ceruse</material>, which makes it bind, making it easier to work. I have seen it used thus. It must be very thick, so that you almost need an effort to spread it with your <tool>brush</tool>. And it will be all the better if you lay down your painting. All these difficulties do not occur when it is very fine and fluid without being crushed, and it doesn't run.

<block purpose="observation"><color>Azure</color> needs to be applied neatly, which is why it always fades when it is applied over old, already tarnished, azure to mend an old painting. In such cases, it is better to scrape off the old layer and prime again and then apply the <color>azure</color>. It is the same for almost all other colors. Also <color>azure</color> mixed with <material>oil</material> always remains shiny, which is not good for azure because that makes it fade.
