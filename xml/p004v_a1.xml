        <purpose type="making"> Take <material>linseed oil</material> or, for a cheaper option,
                <material>walnut oil</material>, and rid it of fat with
                    <material_format><material>garlic</material> cloves</material_format> and
                <material>hog's fennel</material> (some also add
                    <material_format><material>bread</material> crusts</material_format>), which you
            will boil in it for <time>a good quarter of an hour</time>. Then add to <unit>one
                pound</unit> of the <material>oil</material> boiled in this way a piece of
                <material>black pitch</material>
            <unit>the size of a walnut</unit> and <unit>a double handful</unit> of
                <material>wheat</material>, without removing the <material>garlic</material> and
                <material>onions</material>, and allow to boil together for <time>a good quarter of
                an hour</time>. Once the <material>pitch</material> is well melted and the
                <material>oil</material> takes on body, you can remove it from the
            <tool>fire</tool>.</purpose>
        <purpose type="application">Then, to varnish, place your
            <material>iron</material><!--technically, iron is what the varnish is applied to, not a material in a recipe per se-->
            over a <tool>warm charcoal fire</tool> and apply with a <tool>feather</tool> or a
                <tool>brush</tool>. When you see that it no longer smokes, it is done and your
            varnish is dry.</purpose>

        <purpose type="advice">For an excellent black varnish, add <unit>two or three</unit>
            <material>paternoster beads</material> to the rest.</purpose>

        <purpose type="observation">Some consider <material>walnut oil</material> to be
            better.</purpose>

    <block position="left-top">
        <purpose type="advice">If there is a quantity of varnish, it needs to boil for <time>at
                least half a day</time>, because the more it boils, the better it is. Should the
            varnish boil over, it is dangerous for it to catch fire and it is difficult to
            extinguish. So do this in a courtyard or other open space.</purpose>

    <block position="left-middle">
        <purpose type="advice">In <unit>five or six lbs.</unit> of <material>oil</material>, one
            must put <unit>one lb.</unit> of <material>galipot</material>, which costs <currency>4
                sols</currency>, and some <material_format>peeled <material>garlic</material>
                cloves</material_format>. This varnish is not black in and of itself, but turns
            black when exposed to <tool>fire</tool>.</purpose>
