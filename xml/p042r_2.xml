    <heading>Wax for seals and impressions</heading>

    <block>For large wax seals, you should always have tepid <material>water</material> handy, and
        keep your <material>wax</material> in it. Yet previously you should have kneaded it with
        your hands, so as to make it very smooth and even, for otherwise the water would penetrate
        the wax and prevent it from holding together. Afterwards, you can imprint whatever you want.
        Cover the wax in three or four sheets of <material>paper</material>, and, with a round and
        smooth <tool>stick</tool> similar to a <tool>pestle</tool>, roll it out as if to polish it.
        It will then stick to the paper, helping you to take it off from the seal. In this way you
        will imprint better than if you were dripping molten wax. You can carve figures and color
        them in gold, in silver, or paint them with <material>couleurs à vernis</material>, and
        transfer them onto a <material>glass pane</material> painted with <material>couleurs à
            tourmentine</material> &amp; <material>mastic</material>. And if you want to apply these
        designs by inlaying, use <material>gum ammoniacum</material> mixed with
            <material>vinegar</material>, and it will stick well.</block>
