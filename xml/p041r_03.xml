    <block>The <material>sand</material> to be used for casting should be chosen such that it is not
        too dry for it won't hold together, nor should it be too fat. And although you find some in
        nature, however, it is not everywhere. And if you are in a place where it is not found, you
        can put it together yourself but not from <material>fat earth</material>, because the sand
        should contain none at all, since it makes it porous. But you can make it bind by mixing it
        with <material>brick</material> well ground on <material>marble</material>, or
            <material>plaster</material> or <material>calcinated alabaster</material> or something
        similar, or the burned <material>marrow</material> of ox horn or burned
            <material>asphalt</material>. If you grind it quite finely on <tool>porphyry</tool>, it
        binds better &amp; then you can burn it with asphalt or mix it with a quarter of
            <material>tripoli</material>. Make sure no bread falls into your sand because this makes
        it porous.</block>
