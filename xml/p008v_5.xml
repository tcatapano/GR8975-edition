        <purpose type="making">Take the <tool><material_format>finest
                    <material>sandstone</material></material_format></tool> you can find and make a
            cavity in the middle. And put in it <unit>an eighth part</unit> of
                <material>☿</material> and rub it and wear it down while adding some
                <material>water</material> with <material>☾</material> or <material>☼</material>
            until the material becomes paste-like and even harder. Then, if you want, corrode it
            with <material_format>good <material><foreign language="latin">aqua
                    fortis</foreign></material></material_format>, if it is <material>☾</material>
            or <material>♀</material>. Then melt it again, having taken it out as you know. The
                <material>☾</material> will have some color, and after being melted it will leave
            some flecks of <material>☼</material>, and the <material>♀</material> will be very fine
            and will have almost no covering.</purpose>
