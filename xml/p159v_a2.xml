<heading>Carnation</heading>

<block>Mold a carnation like a <material>rose</material>, <material>marigold</material>, and all other <material>flowers</material> as discussed, that is to say cast the <material>flowers</material> in one mold, and the <material>leaves</material> in two parts in order to solder them onto the <material>flower</material>, this is the better way. But you could <material>mold</material> the flower and the leaves together in one single closed mold. <purpose type="advice">I tried one which came out well from the mold. But the sand must be very thin, and you must blow very strongly.</purpose></block>
