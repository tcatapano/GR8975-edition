    <heading>Pounce for scratching satin</heading>

    <block>After pouncing with <material>crushed flour</material> or <material>chalk</material>, in
        order that the dots of the pounce not be erased, go over the trace with <material>egg
            white</material> beaten with the <material>milk or bark of a fig tree</material>, which
        will immediately make the egg white clear up like water, without becoming opaque, it will
        maintain the trace that you will go over again and scratch with a <tool>piece of
            glass</tool> or <tool>penknife</tool>.</block>
