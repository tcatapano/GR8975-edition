        Do not use a graft from old wood, because it never makes a beautiful tree.
        
        Leave only two shoots on the graft and no more, otherwise it will become weaker. The wind torments it and leaves it strengthless to propagate by cuttings.
        
        Trees which have big pith, such as peach trees, and all other trees of their kind, and the plum trees, can't be grafted when freezing because the cold damages their pith, which also has to be protected avoiding to cut the bottom of the graft.
        
        All grafts must not be done earlier than the sap flows up, otherwise they dry.
