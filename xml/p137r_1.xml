    <purpose type="making"/>
    <activity type="casting"/>
    <block> Pure cauldron <material>red copper</material>, or copper of any other small works, is good to cast. To make
        it runny, add some <material>sal ammoniac</material> to it, and when you are about to cast, add a little bit of
        fine <material>tin</material>. One must cast the <material>copper</material> very hot into the mold, so that it is burning and very
        red, like <material>gold</material>, <material>silver</material>, <material>latten</material>, and metal. You will know that it is hot enough when it is
        clear and shining like a newly polished steel mirror, or like melted silver. Protect it from
        wind so that it doesn't cool down too soon. Cover your cast with tow in order to prevent it
        from cooling down. <material>Red copper</material> is cleaner than <material>latten</material>, which smokes a lot, which prevents the
        metal from running. I have moulded it as a noyau very neatly, and as thin as a piece of
        paper. It must be very hot, white and shining like melted silver, or a mirror. I have
        moulded it as a noyau with the same sand mentioned above. </block>
    <block position="left-top"> It takes more time to melt <material>copper</material> and <material>latten</material> than any other metals,
        even <material>red copper</material>. It will run and will comes out well if you cast it very hot, and as thin as
        water. </block>
    <block position="left-top"> Remove your mold from the fire, and set it into embers, which should
        fill a <tool>pot</tool> or <tool>vessel</tool>. </block>
