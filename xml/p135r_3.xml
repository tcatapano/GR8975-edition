    <block> To mold, take <plant>vine leaves</plant> as they are blooming, just as with all herbs &amp; flowers, or
        a young <plant>vine</plant> regrowing after it has been cut or when the leaves come off in autumn, because
        new leaves are knottier &amp; have more evident veins. By contrast, old leaves are smooth
        all the way through &amp; full of holes in many places. Place therefore your leaf, its back
        behind it against the <material>clay plaster</material>, and fasten it with little <tool>pins</tool>. Leave it nevertheless
        with its natural curling. And make a notch in the <material>clay</material> to hide the stem for the first cast.
        And when it's done and dry, take out the stem of the leaf and clean it well with your jacket
        and press it with a little scoop of <material>clay</material>. Afterwards, make many castings around the leaf
        with <material>wax</material>, as you know well, &amp; make a slender casting &amp; with many lines &amp; knots. </block>
    <block position="left-middle"> <plant>Vine leaf</plant> is painted with a <color>green</color> made of <material>scudegrun</material> &amp; verd de
        terre. </block>
    <block position="left-bottom"> You can cast a <animal>spider</animal> or <animal>frog</animal> &amp; whatever you like on the
        leaf. </block>
