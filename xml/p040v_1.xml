    <heading>Cross of the commanders of Malta</heading>
    <block>The fine rouge <material>clair</material> which is the background of the white enamel
        cross is of fine <material>dragon's blood</material> drops soaked with <material>eau de
            vie</material> or <material>Indian laque plate</material>, which I believe is made in
            <place>Flanders</place>, distempered with clear <material>turpentine</material> and
            <material>mastic</material> drops and applied on a <material>silver leaf</material>, not
        the one used by painters but a thicker one, which is burnished by the makers of foil
        backings for <material>gemstones</material> or by goldsmiths, and that gives it its fine
        brilliance.</block>
