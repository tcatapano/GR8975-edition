        <purpose type="making">Heat the <material_format><material>lead</material>
                bullet</material_format> as much as you can without melting it, and once it is hot
            dip it into <material_format>the strongest
                <material>vinegar</material></material_format> that you can. And do this four or
            five times. Afterwards, mince some <material>lard</material> very finely and some
                <material>linen</material> also very delicately, mix all this together and use it as
            wadding, making it go into the arquebus or pistol with a little strength and very
            tightly. And before shooting, if possible, the bullet should be hot.</purpose>
