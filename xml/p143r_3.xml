    <block> Having been molded, you can take it out it without burning it, because it releases
        easilyfrom the mold. Choose the biggest and the lumpiest <animal>toads</animal>. Because they contain a lot
        of metal, it is best to mold them hollow, since they turn out better. You could make your
        cast in one great piece, but it would be troublesome to cut. It is best to do it in three or
        4 parts, which will be thicker close to the animal, and include the most amount of edge that
        is close to the cast/mold. Make as well some casting conduits all the way from the end of
        the cast,</block>

    <block> from one leg to another, so that the spread out limbs are in connection with one another
        due to the aforesaid casting conduits, which you will start in the waxless round parts that
        you have put at the edge of the legs to attract the metal. In this way, because you are
        casting in <material>wax</material>, there is no danger chipping any part of the molded animal. It's quicker to
        make the wax casting conduits thus, because in this way you can cast the second mold after
        the first, rather than wait to do them the conduits after the mold has been recooked,
        because then, if possible, you will need to have everything ready. You need to heat well,
        and even redden the molds where there are wax conduits so that they melt and leave nothing
        inside. </block>
