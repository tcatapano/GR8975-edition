    <block purpose="making"> The <animal>crayfish</animal> is one of the most fantastical to cast,
        but also <!-- <activity type="reference"> -->provides an example for casting
            other difficult things<!-- </activity>  -->. You can distinguish males and female by the eggs that
        the females carry, and by the four little white back legs that males have in their tails
        after behind main eight legs. It is good to dry them out a bit so that the bumps come out
        more hard and beautiful, because none of what is made of shell shrinks. It is true that
        should you dry the little inside legs for too long, they become diminished and have no body.
        If they are too dry, the flesh separates from the scales. Be sure then to maintain the mean.
        They have certain hairs between the legs and at the end of the tail. And because all hair is
        difficult to cast, because it gets mixed up in the sand and does not release, you can burn
        it by putting a <tool>hot iron</tool> on the <animal>crayfish</animal> so that it the hair cannot be seen. As
        for animals that have hair or feathers, you must grease the hair with <material>wheat
            oil</material>, which is very dry and which will make the hair lay flat and straight. In
        this way, you will have form of your animal and you will have the hair. Should it the hair
        be wavy, it can be repaired. If your crayfish has eggs, which are delicate, and which will
        be difficult to take out of the mold without breaking, you would do better to make the first
        cast with the crayfish on its belly and eggs. In this way, you will open the mold with it
        the <animal>crayfish</animal> on its back, which will be hard and easy to manipulate. And the belly and the
        eggs will remain in the mold. And rather than opening your mold for the second time, you
        will have to burn it with them in it. This way, it will open easily, and what has been
        burned will come away cleanly. In this way, the second casting, which is done on the first
        one that has successfully taken hold, separates easily from the first, after having been
        refired. This is a singular secret for similar moldings. </block>

    <block purpose="making"> Let your crayfish dry a little in the sun, by itself. If it has spawns,
        they will shrink while drying, and be all the more beautiful for it. Make your paste out of
        yellow <material>potter's earth</material>, just like for the other representations. Lay
        your <animal>crayfish</animal> on it, the back side down, and the other parts which are more tricky to mold
        -- legs, belly, eggs - side up. Drive in the back side in the <material>clay</material> paste up to the legs,
        which is about the half part of the crayfish's body. Fix the body with a pointy <material>iron thread</material>
        in the middle and, if you feel you need it, you can also drive another one at the edge of
        the tail. And in order that the big legs be lower than the head, which is lower because it
        is linked from below, add a little <material>clay</material> under the head. Then add a bit
        of <material>clay</material> under the <material>jacket</material> in order to raise it. Hide the feelers under
        the clay and under the crusher claws, then arrange it as you like. Stretch out the walking
        legs to the joints, and for the first cast, bend the second part of the walking legs. Fix
        the joints of the legs with <material>wax</material> and a warm <material>wire</material> so they will not move. If you want to mould
        something fancier, fix the end of one walking legs on the body or on a crusher claw , using
        the same <material>wax</material>. If the female has spawns, bent half the tail over the
        spawns, and keep the shape by fixing the tail with a <material>wire</material>. Be sure that you will be able to
        clean this part. Finally rub your <animal>crayfish</animal> with <material>spirits</material>, and cast your <material>sand</material>. Once the sand
        is hardened, uncover the back side, the head, the eyes, and the small legs close to the
        crusher claws, and the walking legs all along. One must uncover these parts as much as
        possible. Then bend and cover the spawns again. The other animals </block>

        side of the mouth with melted <material>wax</material> under them. </block>

    <block purpose="making"> are not so uncovered. But since <animal>crayfish</animal> are troublesome to burn &amp;
        clean, you have to uncover them as much as you can, even the little legs just until the
        tips, because they are troublesome &amp; if, in order to not alter them, you have to take
        them out, you could break something of the mold. Having uncovered it with the point of a
            <tool>knife</tool>, like an <tool>engraving stick</tool> or another fitting thing, clean
        off the <material>sand</material> at the joints &amp; elsewhere with your little brush
        really very scrupulously. And if something is loosed from the <animal>crayfish</animal>,
        attach it with <material>wax</material>, as is discussed. And also attach the horns this
        way. And also do the casting the length of the extremes of the little legs with <material>wax</material>. And
        refill the holes that have been made with the needles of <material>iron wire</material> with
        it. And everything being quite clean &amp; having uncovered more than half of it, <material>oil</material> your
        mold after having soaked the back side in water, &amp; do not forget to <material>oil</material> all the fine
        parts that are between the legs and the little beaks; then rub the <animal>crayfish</animal> with <material>spirits</material>.
        And do your second casting after having made the first mold even, so that the cramp-irons
        join better. Your mold must be larger on the side with the impression than on the back. Do
        not open your mold after the second casting, so that it not become clayed &amp; reheated
        &amp; that which is inside not be burned. Do not forget to mix <material>crocum</material> throughout your sand
        when you mold the <animal>crayfish</animal>, because you must really reheat it &amp; the
        <material>crocum</material> withstands this marvelously. To mold a <animal>crab</animal> &amp;
        to mold a <animal>crayfish</animal> are exactly the same. When you have uncovered
        your <animal>crayfish</animal> on one side do not delay at all before doing the second casting, because
        <animal>crayfish</animal> dry out. It is not enough to uncover the <animal>crayfish</animal> such that you see the whole half
        the half you uncover, but take heed that your mold, even when you are uncovering, be good
        and stripped, because if the <animal>crayfish</animal> gets well burnt, you will not be able to open your
        mold without breaking it. </block>

    <block position="top" purpose="making"> Restore it with a <tool>pen knife</tool>, little <tool>chisels</tool>, or
            <tool>engraving sticks</tool>. </block>

    <block position="left-top" purpose="making"> As you see here, but a wax casting all around &amp;
        at the end of the tail, where you will do the principal casting, two or three more.

    <block position="left-middle" purpose="making"> Make the casting with <material>candle
            wax</material> shaped in a thread like a large packthread, the whole length from the end
        of the claws to the extremity of the tail. If there is also some claw end or other part that
        is extended past the rank of the others or is raised up higher or turned up all alone, make
        a wax casting for it from its end just barely not joined to the body or to one of the large
        claws or to some other place where lots of metal will be wedged in. </block>

    <block position="left-bottom" purpose="making"> Having uncovered it, attach &amp; secure the two
