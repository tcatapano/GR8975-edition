        <purpose type="observation">Since <material><plant>millet</plant></material> is naturally
            very dry, <profession>harvesters</profession> thresh it most often in the cool of
                <time>night</time> and in moonlight. Which could not be done with another, wetter,
            grain, because you must let the <tool>sunbeams</tool> pass over it, and one rarely
            threshes it before <time>midday</time>. Immediately after the
                    <material><plant>millet</plant></material> is harvested, the earth needs to be
            plowed because its roots eat and make lean the soil as much as if the
                    <material><plant>millet</plant></material> was still standing. The ground where
                    <material><plant>millet</plant></material> will have been sown becomes quite
            diminished in fertility, which you can tell next time it is sown. But more than any
            other the grain called <material><plant><foreign language="french"
                    >pomole</foreign></plant></material> in <place>Gasconyor</place> or
                        <material><plant><foreign language="french"
                >baillard</foreign></plant></material> in northern <place>France</place>, makes the
            earth shake, according to the common saying, seven years later. <plant>Broad
                beans</plant> improve and enrich the soil, provided that one lets the roots and
            stems rot in it.</purpose>
