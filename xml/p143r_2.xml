    <block> Those who mould from across the way make their <material>sand</material> from
            <material>crocum ferri</material> and <material>calcinated slate</material>, but
            <material>slate</material> always retains its bumpiness and swells because it is a
        fatty. In the <material>noyau</material>, it is not good; in <material>sand</material>, it
        can be put to use. They the <profession>moulders</profession> from <place>Foix</place> sieve
        their sand, grind it on porphyry, and soak it in water, and they keep the finest bits which
        are on the top, then they reheat it. </block>
