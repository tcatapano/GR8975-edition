    <heading>Glassmaker's black</heading>
    <block>Filings of <material>iron</material> taken from bars that have been in the fire for a
        long time, which are thick, are much better than the common soft ones that fall under the
            <tool>anvil</tool> in the <tool>forge</tool>, because they imitate niello. To said
        black, described elsewhere, some people add a little <material>minium</material>.</block>
