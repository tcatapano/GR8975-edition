<block>Beat it very finely and thinly on a <tool>well-cleaned anvil</tool>, then dilute your <material>glue</material> with <material>spirits</material>, put the mixture on <tool>hot ashes</tool>, and on a <tool>low fire</tool>, it will melt very soon. If the <material>glue</material> is not strong and thick enough, add <material>spirits</material> in greater quantity. <purpose type="advice">Do not melt it in a fatty pot, but in a new pot if possible. It melts on fire and dries very quickly on fire.</purpose> When your <material>glue</material> sets on the work, heat it away from fire, it will stick very strongly. One reworks <material>flowers</material> and delicate things made from <material>silver</material>, <material>gold</material>, <material>tin</material> and other <material>metal</material> with this glue which will not spoil your work.</block>
