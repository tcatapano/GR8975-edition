<block>Try to make one side as thick as the other, that way the two parts will be equally reheated. You can open this kind of mold in order to clean it, when you mold some animals, like crayfish, which burn. When your mold is reheated, do not wait too long before casting again, because it gets damp and loses its strength.</block>
