    <heading>Grain of lead</heading>

    <block position="middle">Take a <tool>playing card</tool>, pierced with a <tool>pin</tool> or <tool>needle</tool>, folded over on all four sides. Hold it
    with the end of a small split <tool>stick</tool> and, holding said stick by the other end, put your card three or 4 fingers away from the
    water that you will have put in a platter or a similar vessel. Then pour your lead, which should not be too hot, into the card
    and continually tap on the stick that holds it. And thus your lead will turn into round grains. And pass it through a large
    sieve to separate the larger grain from the smaller. The larger one will carry 25 to 30 paces.</block>
