    <heading>Painting enamel azure in oil</heading>

        <activity type="painting"/>
        <purpose type="making"/> This is a secret that is hardly known to common painters. Some take
        the most delicate they can &amp; crush it with <material>ceruse</material>, which binds it,
        and next prick with an <tool>awl</tool> in several places the area they want to paint with
                <material><foreign language="french">azur d’esmail</foreign></material>, such that
        the <material>oil</material> enters &amp; leaks in, &amp; does not cause the
            <material>azure</material>, which in itself is heavy, to run. Others lay the panel flat
        &amp; apply the <material>azure</material> on it, which is also done <foreign
            language="french">à destrempe</foreign>. The main thing is to crush it well on
                <tool><material>marble</material></tool>, and before that, to have washed it
        thoroughly. Some grind it with thoroughly with an <material>egg yolk</material> &amp; then
        wash it in five or six lots of <material>water</material> and lay it on not with a
                <tool><foreign language="french">painceau</foreign></tool>, which would be too soft,
        but with a <tool><foreign language="french">broisse</foreign></tool> highly softened &amp;
        bent, &amp; laying it on thickly as if one were applying it with a <tool>trowel</tool>;
        settling down it evens out and flattens. I have experienced that crushing <material><foreign
                language="french">azur d’esmail</foreign></material> with <material>egg
            yolk</material> &amp; then washing it in several lots of <material>water</material> is
        good, although it loses a little of its vividness in the crushing of it. I have also washed
        it in several lots of <material>water</material> &amp;, when it had settled a little, I
        removed the <material>water</material>, still q blue, with a <tool>sponge</tool> and
        squeezed it into another vessel thus where it settled, &amp; from the residue I had the
            <material>ash</material>, <material><plant>flower</plant></material> and subtlest part
        of the <material>azure</material> without crushing it, which is the best, for in the
        crushing of it, it loses some of its color. Those who make it in <place>Germany</place>
        compose it like <material>enamel</material>, in large pieces which they <tool>pestle</tool>,
        &amp; pass through several <tool>sieves</tool> &amp; wash. </block>
    <block><purpose type="making"/> To make <material>azures</material> beautiful, they wash or soak
        them in a <material_format>rock <material>water</material></material_format>, as they call
        it; it is a <material>water</material> distilled from mines where <material>azure</material>
        or <material><foreign language="french">vert d'azur</foreign></material> is found, which
        distills naturally through the mountain's veins or is distilled with an <tool>alembic</tool>
        par from <material_format>>mineral <material>stones</material></material_format> of
            <material>azure</material> or <material>copper</material>. </block>
    <block><purpose type="making"/>
        <material_format><material>Azure</material> ashes</material_format> are only good for
        landscapes because they die in <material>oil</material>. Only true
            <material>azure</material> lasts. <material><foreign language="french">Azur
                d’esmail</foreign></material> cannot be worked if it is too coarse. Try it,
        therefore, on the fingernail or the <tool><material>oil</material> palette</tool>. If it
        happens to be sandy, do not crush it except with the <material>egg yolk</material> or,
        better yet, wash it in <material_format>clear <material>water</material></material_format>
        &amp; with a sponge remove the <material_format>colored
            <material>water</material></material_format> after it starts to go to the bottom, and in
        this manner you will extract the quite delicate <material><plant>flower</plant></material>,
        which will be easy to work with. </block>
