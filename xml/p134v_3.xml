    <block> If some little pieces of legs cannot be easily removed from <material>gold</material> or
            <material>silver</material> casting, it is because you didn't cast wax under these
        parts. Beat some soldering <material>gold</material> very finely, then cut it into very fine
        flakes, cut the quantity you need. Take some of this phlegm or white and thick saliva which
        is on the teeth, put some of this matter to the place you want to solder with the point of a
            <tool>burin</tool>, then place your flakes, then put to the opposite part a mixture made
        of a small quantity of soaked fat earth and saliva, thanks to the mixture the solder will
        better adhere. Then pulverize a bit of <material>borax</material> on it, and heat up
            <material>Quince pulp seed water</material> to a boil and others too.</block>
