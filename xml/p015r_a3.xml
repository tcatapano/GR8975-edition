    <heading>Casting <material>gold</material> and <material>silver</material></heading>

    <block>The <material>sand</material> must be made from something very dry and arid and reheated
        well because, if it were humid, like <material_format><profession>founder</profession>'s
                <material>sand</material></material_format>, the <material>gold</material> and
            <material>silver</material> would leap out of the <tool>mold</tool> and sustain damage.
        It is also necessary for the <material>earth</material> to absorb the
            <material>metal</material> because <material_format>cast
            <material>gold</material></material_format> or <material_format>cast
                <material>silver</material></material_format> becomes very porous. That is why it
        must be beaten out again, otherwise it is brittle, as seen in spoon handles.</block>
