    <heading>Loading an arquebus</heading>

    <block>You must have different charges depending to the range that you want your
            <tool>arquebus</tool> to have, all of which have a screw on the end that fits in the nut
        of the the said arquebus' <tool>ramrod</tool>. So when you put the
            <material>powder</material>powder in the charge, which is in the <tool>nut</tool>, hold
        the ramrod upright. And raising your arquebus up, insert the said ramrod until the charge is
        in the bottom of the arquebus, then straighten the arquebus, the mouth of the barrel up, and
        remove the ramrod. That way, your powder will now be entirely in the breech without any
        grain or dust that lines the sides of the arquebus, which always has some grime in the
        chamber. That way it will not recoil, and you will shoot more true.</block>
