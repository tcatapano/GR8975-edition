<block><purpose type="advice">If the <material>medal</material> is very thick, do not pour a cast that is as thick; the cast just needs to be half as thick as the <material>medal</material>. But if it is thin, make a cast that is of the same thickness. Do not forget to make vents in the cast or the whole matter will fill with bubbles.</block>

<block position="left-bottom">Never forget to oil the cast with wax when you cast herbs or flowers, otherwise it will break and cannot be taken out.</purpose></block></entry>
