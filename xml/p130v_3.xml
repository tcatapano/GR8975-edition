    <block> After you have molded the first mold as the core, leave it to dry well before removing
        the figure from <material>wax</material>, so that the mold is not ruined. Afterwards, then
        make make a small lasagna of paste as thick as you like, and, once you have greased the
        cavity of your first hollowed mold with <material>butter</material>, apply the paste to it
        [the cavity of the first concave mold] and then the upper part of the second mold. If you
        grease [the mold] with <material>oil</material>, it will be soaked up [into the mold] and it
        will not be as clean as <material>butter</material>.</block>
