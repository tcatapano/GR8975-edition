    <block>Because the feet of these [<animal>lizards</animal>] that are very small are [also] very
        fine, once you have molded the top and you have uncover the vents and underneath the feet
        are covered lightly with <material>wax</material>, and then cast a second mold. And the wax
        that one removes, it leaves a little cast for these said feet, and again such that the
        underneath [part] comes out in one piece that you can repair well, And the scales on top of
        the toes come [out] well.</block>
    <block position="left-top"> Around the big lizard nails, put on each a small round of
            <material>wax</material> to make the cast like this. </block>
