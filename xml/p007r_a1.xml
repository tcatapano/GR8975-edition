    <purpose type="making">Once you have colored or made your <ref identifier="p006v_a2">stamped
        ornament in tin</ref> (as previously described), or in <material>iron</material> or
        <material>copper</material>, you must not put <material>glue</material> as on
        <material>wood</material>, but just have some <ref type="sub_recipe">fatty oil</ref>,
        <sub_recipe>which is made in seven or eight days in the <tool>sun</tool> from
          <material>walnut oil</material> and <material>white lead</material>, stirring often, or
        cooked on <tool>fire</tool> if one should be in hurry</sub_recipe>. Then, with <ref
        type="sub_recipe"> the oil thus made fatty</ref>, grind a little <material>white
        lead</material>, <material>massicot</material> and <material>black graphite</material>, at
      discretion, <unit>as much of one as of the other</unit>.</purpose>
    <purpose type="observation"><material>Minium</material> will color the
      <material>gold</material>.</purpose>
    <purpose type="application">Then apply an even layer of that onto your <ref
        identifier="p006v_a2">stamp</ref>, taking care you do not fill the hollows. And once it is
      almost dry, apply the <material_format><material>gold</material> leaf</material_format> on it
      using <tool><material>cotton</material></tool>. Such <material>gold</material> will withstand
      rain on houses or elsewhere. And if you have made your <material>gilt</material> with
        <material>tinsel</material>, color it with <material_format><material>smoke</material> from
        a partridge or from yellow or red <material>cloth</material></material_format>, and it will
      look as fine as pure <material>gold</material>. You can cover
        trunks, mirrors, bed valances and posts in colored <material>velvet</material> or
          <material>satin</material> and then apply the gilded stamped
      ornament on them with strong <material>glue</material>.</purpose>
