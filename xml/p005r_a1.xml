        <purpose type="observation">+ They are called <material>steel</material> mirrors because in
            the past they were usually made of <material>steel</material> polished with
                    <material_format><material>emery</material> paste</material_format>. But more
            easily, various kinds are made of <material><foreign language="french">cuivre
                    franc</foreign></material>, which is <material>rosette</material> and
                <material>tin</material>, because these can be cast in a <tool>mold</tool> and made
            round, hollow, convex or in whatever various shapes you want to represent.</purpose>

        <purpose type="making">So take <unit>half</unit>
            <material>rosette copper</material> and <unit>half</unit>
            <material_format>soft <material>tin</material></material_format>, i.e. fine and yet
            unused. Place them in a <tool>crucible</tool>, and first melt the
                <material>copper</material>. Once it has been well melted, add the
                <material>tin</material> and mix them together and cast that in a <tool>white stone
                mold with no hole</tool>, and grease the <tool>mold</tool>, which should be
            moderately warm, with <material>oil</material>. Then, once your mirror has been molded,
            you can polish it in this manner.</purpose>

        <purpose type="making">Set one mirror in <tool><material>plaster</material></tool> to hold
            it firmly, then put the other one over it with <material_format>fine
                    <material>sand</material></material_format> between them, and rub one against
            the other, whether they are hollowed or flat, and thus you will polish both at once. If
            you want to polish them on both sides, you only have to switch them, which means putting
            the one that was polishing in the <tool><material>plaster</material></tool> and [using]
            the one which was in the <tool><material>plaster</material></tool> to polish. Once they
            have been polished with you can soften them with <material>tripoli of
                    <place>Venice</place></material> that should not be sandy, and then with
                <material>paste</material>. You use <material>water</material> with
                    <material><foreign language="french">arene</foreign></material> to polish, but
            polishing with <material>tripoli</material> and <material>paste</material> is done dry.
            Once the mirror has been polished, you can set it.</purpose>
