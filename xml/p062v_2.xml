<heading>Perspective</heading>

<block>In order to tell where the vanishing point is one must lay a <tool>ruler</tool> over the lines, and the point will be where the lines meet. Some make a hole at the end of their <tool>rulers</tool> in order to fix the point by that hole while moving the <tool>ruler</tool> about. Others lay a <tool>ruler</tool> across the <tool>panel</tool>,, then on this ruler they place the tip of another <tool>ruler</tool> which, being attached to the former by a <tool>screw</tool>, will move about and reach as far as necessary without losing the point. The <tool>ruler</tool> and <tool>compass</tool> without discernment of the eye will cause errors. Perspective is very difficult.

<block position="left-middle">To paint a perspective in <material>oil</material>, you should not use a <tool>ruler</tool>, for you would smudge everything. Instead, in applying your colors you must keep and follow the lines of your first drawing.
