    <block> They bind <material>silver filings</material> with <material>saltpeter</material> which
        refines it &amp; does not make it brittle. But <material>gold filings</material> are bound
        with <material>borax</material> or, to save the borax, with <material>lead</material>, which
        refines the gold &amp; softens it, for the saltpeter would make it brittle, which it does
        not do to silver. This is why, in order to save, goldsmiths use it to bind it in order to
        save borax, which costs viii sols per ounce &amp; saltpeter costs x sols per lb. When
        goldsmiths have thus bound their silver filings with salpeter, a red enamel vitrifies at the
        bottom of the crucible. I do not know if the <material>copper</material> mixed in with the
        silver is the cause for this. Try for enamel.</block>
