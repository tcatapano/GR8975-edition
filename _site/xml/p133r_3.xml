    <heading>Marks [made by] the [pin] points of iron thread which one finds on the head of an
        animal</heading>
    <purpose type="making"/>
    <activity type="handling and maintenance"/>
    <block> With the <material>points</material> [or <material>pins</material>] with which you have
        dressed [your animal] all over, do same with the head, but [out of] the head which is
        pierced, a certain moisture seeps out around the wound and this little exudation prevents
        the <material>sand</material> from covering the point well and there always remain little
        pinpricks. But to avoid this, you can plant in the plaster of the said blunt pin point and
        around the upper part of the point, and over this point, there put a little hard
            <material>wax</material> or a little <material>mastic</material> or
            <material>cement</material>. And by the medium of the hot <tool>thread of iron</tool>
        there you can hold the throat of the animal which one removes [the iron] when you come to
        uncover the vents and the throat for doing the second cast. </block>
