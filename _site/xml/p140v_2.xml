    <heading>Molding and shrinking a large shape</heading>
    <purpose type="making"/>
    <activity type="handling large shapes"/>
    <block> Mold it with the pith of <material>bread</material> just out of the
        oven, or like that aforementioned, &amp; in drying out it will shrink &amp; consequently so
        will the medal that you will cast. By these means - lengthening out or enlarging the
        imprinted <material>bread</material> - you can vary the shape &amp; from one face make
        several different ones. The <material>bread</material> straight from the oven is best. And
        the one which has been heated twice contracts more. You can cast <material>sulfur</material>
        without letting the imprint on the bread dry, if you want to cast it as large as it is. But,
        if you want to let it shrink, let it dry to a greater or lesser extent. </block>
