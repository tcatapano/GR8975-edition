<heading>Portraits in Wax</heading>

<block>If you do not mix your wax with any <material>color dye</material>, and if you paint some <material>colors</material> on the <material>wax</material>, these <material>colors</material> would fade if you cast it en noyau. But the representation is not damaged, rub it very lightly with <tool>spirits</tool> diluted with hot <tool>water</tool>. If your representations are varnished, repeat the molding process two or three times in order to remove this varnish which sticks to the mold. When the <material>varnish</material> is removed, your mold is very clean. If your representation is set on <material>wood</material>, it is necessary to pour very hot <material>melted wax</material> on the <material>wood</material>, otherwise the mold sticks to the wood. It is much better to mix your white wax with <material>white lead</material> than <material>ceruse</material>, because <material>white lead</material> is whiter and more firm.</block>
