<heading>Killing <animal>snakes</animal> for molding</heading>

<block>Some put a drop of <material>aqua fortis</material> into their mouths, which stupefies them, so that the head and the body look dead. But the head is still alive, and when you stick it with a <tool>needle</tool> in order to fix it to your mold, it moves and spoils and undoes everything. Therefore, to kill your <animal>snake</animal>, put it into a <tool>bottle</tool> filled with good <material>vinegar</material> and some <material>spirits</material>. Do the same with <animal>lizards</animal> and other similar animals.</block>

<block position="left-bottom">If you want to keep them, you can put them in a <tool>pipe</tool> full of <material>dirt</material> in a garden outdoors, but it is necessary that the <tool>pipe</tool> be covered with <material>latten wire</material>, because otherwise, the <animal>snakes</animal> will crawl and climb up quite high.</block>
