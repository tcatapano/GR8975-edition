    <block>When a defluxion occurs in the ear, be very careful not to put anything in it, and
        following the proverb, ears and eyes should only be touched with your elbow. However, to an
        affected ear, it is good to apply <material_format>musky
            <material>cotton</material></material_format>, that is to say,
            <material>cotton</material> kept in <material>musk</material>, which comforts quite
        well.</block>
