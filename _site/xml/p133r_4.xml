    <block> When you have done the first firing and taken off the <tool>clamps</tool> and you have
        opened your mold to clean it by taking off the bubbles with <material>quicksilver</material>
        which one cannot do with closed molds, reclose the mold and reattach the <tool>clamps</tool>
        but not in the same place as the first time. Reapply lute and dry it but if this is for
        casting <material>silver</material> or <material>gold</material> [use] lute with the rest of
            <material>sand</material> which has been used because this is the best netting. If your
        mold is broken in refiring you can augment it with <tool>clamps</tool> and lute. </block>
