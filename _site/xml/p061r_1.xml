    <block purpose="making">It is necessary that you make it of two kinds, one more
            <color>red</color> to make the main layer, the other more pale for the highlights, as
        around the eyes. And then on this last skin color, you will touch lightly the main lights
        with a little <material>white lead</material>. But avoid applying too much of it because
        this will look like a face of death. The beautiful <material>Florence lacquer</material>
        makes a beautiful vivid skin color that resembles the complexion of <color>alexandrine
            pink</color> and <color>incarnadine</color></block>. <margin-block position="left-top"
        purpose="observation"> Certain colors need to be ground like minium or massicot. The
            <material>ashes</material> don't need to be ground at all.</margin-block>
