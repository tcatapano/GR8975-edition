    <heading>Sheared ewes</heading>
    <block>If the shearer wounds them at some point, he applies the very
            <material>excrement</material> of the ewe on it. When they are fat, they are easier to
        shear and do not get hurt as easily.</block>
    <block position="left-middle">If the shearer wants to 'viscorter' them, that is to castrate them
        as [they] are one or two years old, he must not have been with his wife, because this would
        cause the sheep to die.</block>
