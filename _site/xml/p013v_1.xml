    <heading>To recognize <material_format>good <material>azur</material> dust</material_format> for
            <material>oil</material></heading>

    <block>The one that piles up in small clods and is lumpy is the best because it is finer. Also
        the one that is also <color>very pale in color</color>, because <material>oil</material>
        darkens it. Certain <profession>sophists</profession> mix them together, but you will find
        this out if you pour some onto <material_format>a piece of
            <material>paper</material></material_format> and lay it flat and spread it with your
            <tool>finger</tool> since, if it is mixed, it will be found varied and so to say with
        light and darker stripes, but if it is whole it will be even and of one color.</block>
