  <heading>To make <material>vermillion</material></heading>

  <block>Take two pounds of <material>sulphur</material>, and melt it, and add two pounds of <material>mercury</material> to it. And if this material ignites, cover it quite neatly, so that the air does not pass into the <tool>pot</tool>, then put everything for some time after into a <tool>leaded pot</tool>, into the fire. In the space of twenty-four hours, you will have good <material>vermillion</material>.</block>
