    <heading>Making <tool><material>diamond</material> points</tool> for engraving</heading>

    <block>
        <activity type="engraving"/>
        <purpose type="making"/> These are for sketching what you want to draw on
            <material>stones</material> and for engraving. When these points are too dull and cannot
        engrave, it is necessary to rub <material>diamond</material> against
            <material>diamond</material>; one can rub them with <material_format><material>pumice
                stone</material> powder</material_format>. It is necessary to strip what you want to
        engrave on a <tool><material>lead</material> wheel</tool> or with a
            <material>stone</material> or with <material>glass</material>, because the polishing is
        like <material>varnish</material> or <material>glass</material> and stops the
            <material>diamond</material> or <material>sapphire</material> from engraving well. This
        is why it does not engrave easily on <material>horn</material>, which is polished and fat.
        But when the polish has been taken off, it is easy to engrave.</block>
