    <heading>Aqua fortis</heading>
    <block>If your retort is well luted you should not surround it with ashes, which would only
        prevent the vapors from escaping properly. But when, towards the end, you fire it intensely,
        surround it with <material>charcoals</material> lit elsewhere beforehand, such as those in
        the <tool>furnace</tool> should be, so they do not crackle or smoke. Place said lit
        charcoals around the body of the retort, not close to the neck, which does not need to be
        heated as much. The top grate, on which you place your retort, should be sufficiently far,
        one dour or half a foot, from the bottom grate where the charcoal is placed, since thus you
        will not waste as much <material>aqua fortis</material>.</block>
