        <material>Cimolee</material> or <material><profession>fullers</profession>â€™ clay</material>
            (<profession>fullers</profession> meaning those who finish <material>cloth</material>)
        is an excellent material for molding hollow or in relief. If you want to reheat it, it
        should first be warm and you should reheat gently from a distance, and little by little,
        otherwise it will crack. To reheat the figure put it in a <tool>pot</tool> in an
            <tool>oven</tool>, or in a <tool>closed oven</tool>. It comes out very smooth, clean and
        fine. With <material>cimolee</material> you can make a <tool>hollow mold</tool> of an
            <animal>animal</animal> and cast it in <material>lead</material>.</block>

        press all at once, but gently, or else it would split. </block>
