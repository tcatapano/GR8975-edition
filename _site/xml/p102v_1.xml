<heading>Painting on crystal or glass</heading>

<block><activity type="painting"/>They paint without any traces <material>oil</material>, except for faces where they outline the nose and the mouth in very fine <color>black</color> work. Then they make strokes and highlight them in <color>white</color>, and then they apply a coat of <color>flesh-tinted color</color>.  As for the background, they do it in natural <material>azur</material> from <place>Acre</place> to make it more beautiful, or <material>lacquer</material> for a quickly-done <color>red</color>, or for a finer <color>red</color>, <material>dragon's blood</material>. But it is necessary to apply it little by little so that it is smooth and of one color, and in the same way for other colors. Then they apply underneath it, a leaf of <material>topaz</material>, <material>gold</material> or <material>silver</material>.</block>
