    <block> When <profession>goldsmiths</profession> have to solder something quickly but don't have enough time to forge it,
        they melt <material>gold</material> and then they pour it on a <tool>cloth</tool> or on anything else that withstands fire.
        Then they flatten it swiftly with a <tool>hammer</tool> or another similar tool, and it [the gold] is
        very tenuous and it even retains the impression of the cloth. </block>

    <block> Unalloyed pure <material>gold</material> can be cast into a medal but not into <plant>herbs</plant> and <animal>lizards</animal> or other
        very delicate things if it is not alloyed. </block>
    <block> A <plant>pansy</plant> which is oiled with <material>wheat oil</material> can be cast with alloyed <material>gold</material>. </block>
    <block> And other <plant>fruit leaves</plant>, but with branch[es] that are not large and especially the
        leaves, once cast, can be soldered. </block>
