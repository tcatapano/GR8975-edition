    <block purpose="advice">Make some notches in them the molds that enter more into the inside of
      the mold than the outside because in this way, they have more strength. Take care to keep from
      reheating them suddenly in a burning hot fire, because this will make them break. </block>

    <block position="right-middle" purpose="advice"> Do not keep them molds in a humid place, nor an
      enclosed place if they are not well dry, because they will mold. The same with dried animals. </block>

    <block position="left-middle" purpose="advice"> It is not at all necessary to reheat the molds
      two times when the animal can pull away without burning, as do <animal>toads</animal>, which can very well be
      molded hollow like all thick animals. However, it is always good to redden the mold once. </block>
