    <block> You must cut it inside the mold in order to burn it. Cut it with <tool>scissors</tool>
        at once, that way blood doesn't flow on the mold, and doesn't make dirty. Because this dirt
        would be removed with difficulty when reheated. Then place your mold into a furnace, or
        something similar, in order to quickly dry the mold which must be removed before the forming
        of crusts or molds.@ </block>
    <block position="left-middle"> + When you mold small <animal>lizards</animal>, and when you want
        to peel away the first molded part, start to peel away the heads, you will know its place
        thanks to the <tool>needle</tool>. Don't peel away the legs before peeling away the entire
        body, to avoid that the naked body, moving,doesn't remove the legs from their place, which
        would not be easy to put back into place. When you remove the small <tool>needles</tool>
        fixing the legs, block the legs or press the legs with something, that way while removing
        the <tool>needles</tool> the legs won't move; finally, you can fix the legs again with
            <material>wax</material>.</block>
