    <block> You can use the mixture made of <material>crocum ferri</material> to cast
            <material>silver</material> or <material>gold</material>, this mixture will make these
        casts firm, and prevent these from cracking and making burrs. And I believe that for flat
        things, it would withstand severa casts. Which however is not commonly done for
            <material>gold</material> and <material>silver</material>. </block>
