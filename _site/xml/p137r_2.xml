            <material>venice</material>, and not sublimate of <material>arsenic</material>,
            <material>aes ustum a poix</material>, <material>sal ammoniac</material>, <material>a
            poix</material>. Ground everything separately, then blend them together in a <tool>glass
            bottle</tool>, and put it on <material>warm ashes</material>. You will see that
        everything melts like wax, and will have bright colors. Leave to set, add a small quantity

        <profession>Foundry workers</profession> who make large casts to mold statues, clean the
        dirt from these molds with <material>calamine</material>, and a lot of <material>sal
            ammoniac</material> in order to make moulds clear and neat. When they want to cast they
        add a lot of tin. Dampness and cold could spoil their works, that is the reason why even a
        small source of water in the hole can damage the whole thing. </block>
