    <heading>Dyers’ woad</heading>
    <block> It is grown in <place>Lauragais</place> where the deep soil is so fertile that every
        year wheat was grown there, it would lie flat for being too vigorous. This is why dyers’
        woad and wheat are grown there alternately. For cultivating dyers’ woad, the soil is
        ploughed with <tool>iron shovels</tool>, as gardeners do. Next, it is harrowed with
            <tool>rakes</tool>, &amp; broken up finely as for sowing some kitchen herbs. It is
        commonly sown on Saint Anthony's day in January. Eight harvests are made. The first ones are
        better. The best dyers’ woad of Lauragais is the one from <place>Carmail</place> &amp; the
        one from <place>Auragne</place>. And sometimes the dyers’ woad is good in one field &amp; in
        the one close by it will hardly have worth. The goodness of the dyers’ woad can be
        recognized when put in the mouth it gives the taste of vinegar, or when crumbling &amp;
        breaking it, it has some mold-like veins which are as it were golden or silver. It is
        assayed in the <tool>dyers' vat</tool>, and to fill a vat with it, six bales of it are
        needed. There several flocks of <material>wool</material> are dyed, and if it dyes fifteen
        times, it is said to be worth 15 florins, if it gives xx dyings, xx florins. The good kind
        dyes up to 30 times &amp; commonly up to xxv or 26.</block>
