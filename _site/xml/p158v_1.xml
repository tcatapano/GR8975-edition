    <heading>Colors for green leafs</heading>

        <purpose type="making">One usually paints them with <material><foreign>oil</foreign> colors</material>, because
            distemper colors do not stay on. For <material>marigold flowers</material>, lightly
            ground <material>minium</material> for some of them; for more yellowish ones, mix in a
            bit of <material>massicot</material>. For green, the <material>vert-de-gris</material>
            is dark and too somber. If it is a yellowish-green, you can mix with the
                <material>vert-de-gris</material> a bit of yellow ochre and scudegrum. If the green
            is dark, mix in some coals made from peach pits, which makes a greenish-black, in the
            same way than the bone of an ox foot bone makes a bluish-black. And in such a manner, by
            judgement and discretion, put the color on the natural flower or leaf to see whether it
            is similar to the original. But paint it on very lightly so as not to cover the features
            of the work.</purpose>
