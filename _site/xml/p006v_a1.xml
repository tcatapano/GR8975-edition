    <purpose type="application">You can embellish them with thin
          <material_format><material>enamel</material> canes</material_format> of various colors by
      covering the <material>yellow latten</material> or <material_format><material>iron</material>
        wire</material_format> with said
      canes.<!--should I mark up "said canes" as a "material"? That opens the door to marking up pronouns too. My instinct is no, unless a prospective user was actually interested in pronouns and substitutions--></purpose>
    <purpose type="advice">These you will break neatly into the length that you want if you make a
      small notch with a <tool>cutting file</tool> at the point where you want to break them, and
      they will not break anywhere else. You can bend them with a <tool><material>wooden</material>
        model</tool> over a <tool>brazier</tool> or by the <tool>heat</tool> of a
      <tool>lamp</tool>.</purpose>
    <purpose type="observation">A <material_format>cane</material_format> can be stretched out as
      long as you want in a small <tool>furnace</tool> made like a reverberatory
      oven<!--is this also worth marking up as a tool?--> but with openings on both sides. And once
      the large <material_format>cane</material_format> is red, they seize the hot end of it with
      small <tool><tool>pincers</tool> that have long beaks</tool>, with one end of the beak inside
      the end of the <material_format>cane</material_format>, so that it may be stretched without
      becoming blocked. The other end of the <material_format>cane</material_format> is held with
      the <tool>hand</tool>, as it is not hot. Once the <material_format>cane</material_format> is
      stretched enough, the one who is working seated with his <tool>stove</tool>, <unit>the size of
        a carnation pot</unit>, placed in front of him, breaks it off and carries on. This is for
      making <material_format>cane</material_format> for capes, which may be cut, as already
      mentioned, with a <tool>file</tool>. <profession>Glass-button makers</profession> also use the
      said <tool>stove</tool>.</purpose>
