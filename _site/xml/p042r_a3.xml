    <heading>Casting in plaster</heading>

    <block>Melt some <material>wax</material>, and with a big <tool>brush</tool> coat it over the
        relief of which you want to have the cave, as if you wanted to paint it. And a light crust
        will be formed upon which you will cast <material>plaster</material>, to give it shape and
        consistency. Afterwards, in the cave of the wax, cast your plaster as well to get the
        relief, and it will come out very easily, because of the wax. This is done more often for
        large pieces in haut relief than for others.</block>
