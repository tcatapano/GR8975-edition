<heading>Chassis used by Germans</heading>

<block purpose="observation"><Foreign>Germans</Foreign> who work in small scale make 'chassis" not of <material>glass</material> but of <tool>canvas</tool> oiled with clear <material>turpentine varnish</material>, that is half of <material>turpentine oil</material> and almost half of <material>turpentine</material>, because such light, being less bright than glass, makes the lines appear thicker. And when they want to make something more delicate, such as veins and similar things, they use <tool>brushes</tool> made of two or three <material>rat hairs</material>.
