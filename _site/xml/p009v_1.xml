        <purpose type="observation"/> They melt <material>orpiment</material> entirely in a
            <tool>glass bottle</tool> on <tool>very hot ashes</tool>, but it would be more
        appropriate to sublimate <material>orpiment</material> in a <tool>long-neck matrass</tool>
        as for making garnets<material/>. The <material>orpiment</material> thus turns red like red
            <material>enamel</material> and it has to be ground first in
            <material>distemper</material>, because once entirely melted it is very brittle and
        difficult to grind. Then, once dry, you can thin it with <material>oil</material> and it
        will make a deep and saturated yellow. But to prevent <material>orpiment</material> from
        fading in contact with other colours and make it compatible with these and to make it dry
        quickly, a most rare secret is to calcine <material_format>common
            <material>salt</material></material_format> and to grind it together with the
            <material>orpiment</material>. <material>Green verditer</material> is not used with
            <material>oil</material>.
