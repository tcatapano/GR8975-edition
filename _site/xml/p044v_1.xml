    <heading>Horsehair sieves</heading>

    <block>They are made often in <place>Normandy</place> with <material>horsetail hairy</material>
        that they clean with some washing <material>water</material> because they pick them out with
        their mouth and separate short and broken ones. They do not make the
            <material>thread</material> longer than the <tool>sieve</tool> and it is round. They
        attach the black or white <material>hair</material> at the two edges of the thread,
        according to the piece they want to make. And the thread is woven above and below like any
        other fabric. And passing a small flat <tool>stick</tool> of ii or three fingers wide
        between two, they pass between after two bits of hair at each step strike and weave with
        three steps. The entire sieve is made of xvii bits of hair. They sell them by dozens and
        each xxx sols. They bring them to <place>Toulouse</place> to send them then to
            <place>Spain</place> and there, they exchange it with <material>silk</material>.</block>
