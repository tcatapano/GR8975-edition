<heading>[Stone alum]</heading>

<block><activity type="casting"/><material>Stone alum</material> must be reheated in a <tool>pot</tool> covered with a <tool>tile</tool> over a good <material>charcoal</material> fire so that the impurities which might be in it [are] burned with that which does not burn. This is done either in the <tool>goldsmith forge</tool> surrounded by <material>bricks</material> or in a little <tool>oven</tool> vented to the fusion fire such that the <tool>pot</tool> stays red for a quarter of an <time>hour</time>. This is more to purify it than for anything else. It becomes <color>reddish</color> on top and the inside remains <color>white</color> and dries best this way.#</block>

 <block position="left-middle"><activity type="casting"/> # Once your <material>stone alum</material> is cooled down, crush it in a <tool>mortar</tool>, then grind it more finely on <tool><material>marble</material></tool>. And this makes it into very fine wooly dust that gives binding to <material>sand</material> without burning like all other things. [This is] a beautiful invention. Crush it on the <tool>mortar</tool> to being careful to keep the grindings together because the dust flying can get down your collar or on your face which can have very grave consequences. Put a little each time in the <tool>mortar</tool> to avoid the dust flying. It is best to grind therefore with the <tool>pestle</tool> trained on the <tool>mortar</tool> rather than on the <tool><material>marble</material></tool> where it spreads and on the <tool>mortar</tool> it gathers [the dust] from all sides and renders it very fine and sweet to the touch.</block>
