    <block> It oftens happens when you cast two or three molds one after the other using the same
        <tool>dish</tool>, because the last casting comes from the bottom of the <tool>dish</tool> and is thicker, and then
        often the last cast which comes from the bottom and which is the thickest of the <tool>dish</tool>, may
        easily become porous. Cast thinner and neater, as long as you blow very strongly on the
        soaked <material>sand</material> while casting in order to clear the little air bubbles. </block>
