<block purpose="painting">First one roughs them out in <color>gray</color> or in <color>purple</color>, which is made of <material>azure ash</material> and <material>lake</material>. Once dry, one highlights and finishes with flesh tones and other colors and <color>white</color>. And it will look better and is quicker to do than in <color>black</color> and <color>white</color>. Armies are painted the same way.
