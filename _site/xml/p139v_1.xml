            Take some <material>white wax</material> which is much more
            appropriate for this kind of work than anything else, because it is much firmer and does
            not leave as much filth, as much as you need to cast the animal that you propose, and no
            more. And [take] a half quantity of ground <material>coal</material> and neatly sieved
            through a <tool>cloth</tool> or <tool>coal sleeve</tool>, using it to give some color to your <material>wax</material>,
            that would otherwise be transparent and you will not be able to see your lines as
            clearly. Put your <material>wax</material> on the coal fire to melt. And when it is well-melted and
            well-liquified, have, for a full <tool>eared-porringer</tool> of melted wax, as much
                <material>sulphur</material> as a large walnut. Pulverize it. Melt it over a slow
            fire and when it is melted, do not leave it on the fire because it will become too hard.
            But take it off and keep stirring it with a little stick and when it has finished
            bubbling and is as liquified as water, cast it into the wax that you will have
            previously removed from the fire. And mix and stir both of the them so that they join
            together. After stir in little by little while continuously mixing, the charcoal that
            has been repeatedly ground, and in this way it will be very well incorporated. This is
            how you will know that your wax has gone beyond its ideal heating point, it will release
            no more smoke, it will start to have lines appearing on the side and not in the middle,
            and those lines will be close to each other. If you cast too hot, you will not be able
            to separate your <material>wax</material> from your mold and it would stick to the cast. When it is at the
            right state, stir it with a little stick so that the pulverized
                <material>charcoal</material> is well mixed in and has not fallen to the bottom of
            the mixture. And in this way, throw it in your mold bit by bit and not in one go,
            because <material>wax</material> is not runny </block>

            is for fashioning round figures that do not come out of the mold. And they need to be
            burned in the moule au <material>noyau</material> rather than be opened like the ones
            that have something jutting out or an intertwining of legs and arms. And this <material>wax</material>,
            thanks to the <material>sulphur</material>, will melt with little heat and leave without leaving any filth.
            If by some misfortune the crushed charcoal remains in ashes, when you open the mold and
            blow on it, it will come clean. </block>

        <!-- in the block below there is a mention of preceeding recipes, how far back in terms of recipes does such a reference go; how do we reference these other recipes here? -->

        <block identifier="p139v_a1" purpose="making"> not like other things. And for this one, you
            can cast two or three times until your mold is full. Now, concerning this mold of
            pulverized <material>white plaster</material> &amp; reheated in the manner of the <material>sand</material>
            from the preceding recipes, you should have made it long ago because it is used many
            times. But, before using it, soak it for a good hour in cold water, &amp; at a minimum,
            at least as long in hot water that at first is so hot that you can't hold your finger in
            it. And note that it absorbs no more, but that it appears very wet overall without water
            seeping into it. In removing it closed from the hot water, cast your <material>wax</material> in such a state
            of heat as has been described. And neither the first nor the second casting will readily
            come out well, hardly, until the mold is soaked. Let it cool down before opening it so
            that the cast thing not break. You will know that the casting is good when the <material>wax</material>
            coming back out of the mold is thin and even. Remember to make several castings along
            the whole length of the mold so that in this way the wax runs better. Make the
                first<figure identifier="fig_p140r_1"
                url="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9-oNrvWdlO5NFdsdU4tVFgxOTg"/>casting twice
            as large as other molds. And if, in the first casting, your work fills with bubbles and
            in so doing does not come out neatly, it's all the same, because you have to face the
            fact that the three or four first do not readily come out well. Firstly, you will know
            whether there are a few barbs that keep it from stripping well. And you will remove them
            if, on their own, they do not remove themselves in the two or three first castings. And
            the more that you cast, the more you will do it neatly. And your mold will serve you
            more than one hundred times if it Is well governed. But it is good to soak it one night
            or one day before casting so that it be well soaked. The same must be done for fruits
            made from sugar. This <material>wax</material> is very soft &amp; friendly &amp; pliant, like <material>copper</material>. And if
            it is hard [this is] because of <material>sulfur</material>, which makes it melt more
            easily than than other [wax], so much that you can see evidence on a hot slate. And the
            <material>sulfur</material> that you put inside will be found the second time that you melt it, [as] cracks
            on the bottom. Having in this way passed through wax, it will not catch fire at all when
            put to a candle. And in this case, I believe that it will cast quite the medal
            [illegible]. One uses the same wax in place of varnish to [illegible]. </block>

            you can cast its cavity on it in <material>copper</material>, <material>gold</material>, and <material>silver</material>, and make really singular
