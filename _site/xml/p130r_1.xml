    <heading> Drying animals in an oven </heading>
<purpose type="making"/>
    <activity type="drying animals"/>

    <block>One can skin small <animal>cats</animal> and remove their eyes and all their guts. Then place a small
        <tool>stick</tool> vertically between the teeth in order to open their mouths. Then with <tool>iron nails</tool> one
        should attach their feet to a small board, arrange the required position. Once they are tied
        by their feet with small <tool>iron rings</tool>, one has to hang them upside down into the sun. By doing
        so, they will get the right shape and dry, the belly will tighten and the the tail will
        remain high up thanks to the twist that you made. Once they are already a bit dry, one may
        twist the head as he wishes and secure the position with any tool. One may finish to dry the
        animal by placing it in an oven once the bread has been taken off. Then place some
        realistically painted <material>lead balls</material> or <material>wax balls</material> in the eye-sockets. One should paint them with
        gummed ink so that they look like jet. One can add a painted tongue, or horns, or wings or
        anything you may imagine, same goes for <animal>rats</animal> or any animal. </block>
