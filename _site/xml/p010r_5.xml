        weight to flow. Taking i <unit>lb.</unit> of <material>lead</material>, melt it and skim and
        purify it from its filth, then pour into it four <unit>â„¥</unit> of <material_format>finely
            ground common <material>salt</material></material_format>, and take care that there are
        no stones or earth. And immediately after pouring it, stir continuously very well with an
            <tool>iron tool</tool> until the <material>lead</material> and <material>salt</material>
        are quite incorporated, and take it immediately off the <tool>fire</tool>, stirring
        continuously. And if it seems too coarse, grind it on a
                    <tool><material_format><material>marble</material> slab</material_format></tool>
        and pass it through a <tool>fine sieve</tool>, then wash it as many as times as necessary
        until the <material>water</material> runs clear, throwing out the fine powder that will
        float on it, renewing the <material>water</material> as many times as necessary until it is
        completely cleared. </block>
