    <block>Take half an ounce of soft <material>tin</material>, melt it in a <tool>spoon</tool>.
        Once it is melted, throw in an ℥ of ☿, mix together. Once they are cold, grind on a
            <tool>porphyry slab</tool>. Then take an ℥ of <material>sal ammoniac</material> and an ℥
        of the yellowest <material>sulfur</material> that may be found, grind both. And then mix
        very well all the aforementioned materials. Then put all together into a <tool>glass
            sublimatorium</tool>. Hold this over a small fire for an hour, and for an hour over a
        stronger fire, and for an hour over a very strong fire, and it will be ready. Then, to use
        it, apply <material>resin</material> black with the <material>glue</material> used by
        painters to paint, two or three times, until it is quite black. Then apply a bit of
            <material>varnish</material>. Once it is dry, apply the <material>purpurine</material>
        dry with a <tool>finger</tool> where you want. The more you apply, the finer it will look.
        Then, if you like, you can apply varnish on top.</block>
