And stir continuously over a charcoal fire until the sandarac is well melted, which you will know by taking a little of the said varnish on a plate and, if it is fat enough when you handle it with a finger, it is ready. And for one pound of lavender spike oil, you should put five ounces of ground sandarac.  Some only put in four ounces but this is not as good, nor as fat. The former dries promptly. To avoid the trouble of polishing their ebony, framemakers varnish it with this. So do guitarmakers. This varnish is not as fitting for paintings as fine turpentine varnish, though it is good for the paintings’ moldings. When linseed varnish was in use, one would not commonly varnish the landscape of a painting because it would turn the landscape yellow. But with turpentine varnish one varnishes everywhere. Instead of sandarac, you can add to it pulverized mastic drop by drop or otherwise, and it will dry more quickly.  If you want to varnish plaster or a wall, first put on your colle de retaille, very hot, because if cold it would not penetrate the wall at all. And when you would have put your varnish on, it would come off.\n\n\n  at left top  margin of folio 004r\n\n  Aspic oil varnish is not as apt for colors as that of turpentine, because aspic oil eats the colors, since it is too penetrating.\n\n\n",

If one wants to see oneself from behind, you have to place the concave mirror on the ground on its foot, at a slant, and then look at it one step further. But if you look at it from a closer position, it shows you the right way up but with the face quite large and the hairs of your beard as thick as\n- - - - - 005v - - - - - \n a string and will reflect a nipple as large as a plate, and women can see the secret places they do not want to show to surgeons. It projects the reflection outwards, and if you touch with your finger the eye of the reflection, another finger will come against yours. You will be able to provide light at night for someone quite far away, if you set the concave mirror behind a candle placed on a window sill. You will be able to read and write quite far from the candle if you set it behind the candle and turn the concave face towards you. If you put the mirror at the far end of a table with a candle on it, it will reflect two lights on the table for you. To see what is happening in a street, shut the window, or the more you can shut the better, make a hole in the bottom pane, the size of your little finger, perfectly round all the way through. Then apply a sheet of paper onto the window and let the middle of the sheet be over the hole. Pierce the sheet in the same place as the hole and of the same size. Then turn the concave face of the mirror towards the hole, and anyone passing by in the street will be reflected on the sheet of paper. Do the same with the pierced door of a closed room. You can make wavy mirrors and triangular ones, such as are described by Ptolemy and Archimedes. The concave sort can also set fire to straw or light a candle from afar, using the sun. By reverberating fire too, it can provide warmth.\n\n",

Therefore, for burnished gold take good chalk, quite white, well ground and soaked with distemper glue and do four coats of it, one after the other, on the wood. And when the last one is dry, rub it with prêle, which is a kind of grass otherwise named horsetail, to render it well polished. Afterwards, take fine Armenian bole and sanguine, as much of one as of the other, a bit of lamb tallow the size of a bean or a pea depending on the quantity of bole, and a little willow charcoal, or as much as the tallow, and half a walnut shell filled with half—burned saffron; some put in a little candi sugar.

And if you want to set rouge clair and glaze with it, grind Venice lake on the marble with walnut oil or linseed oil. After grinding, mix in turpentine varnish or spike lavender varnish and apply on gold with the brush. Brazilwood and laque ronde fade. For green, temper verdigris with walnut oil or linseed oil and grind it, then mix in some turpentine varnish; not aspic varnish, which is not suitable for verdigris.

Immediately after the millet is harvested, the earth needs to be plowed because its roots eat and make lean the soil as much as if the millet was still standing. The ground where millet will have been sown becomes quite diminished in fertility, which you can tell next time it is sown.

Some take the most delicate they can &amp; crush it with ceruse, which binds it, and next prick with an awl in several places the area they want to paint with azur d’esmail, such that the oil enters &amp; leaks in, &amp; does not cause the azure, which in itself is heavy, to run. Others lay the panel flat &amp; apply the azure on it, which is also done à destrempe. The main thing is to crush it well on marble, and before that, to have washed it thoroughly. Some grind it with thoroughly with an egg yolk &amp; then wash it in five or six lots of water and lay it on not with a painceau, which would be too soft, but with a broisse highly softened &amp; bent, &amp; laying it on thickly as if one were applying it with a trowel; settling down it evens out and flattens. I have experienced that crushing azur d’esmail with egg yolk &amp; then washing it in several lots of water is good, although it loses a little of its vividness in the crushing of it. I have also washed it in several lots of water &amp;, when it had settled a little, I removed the water, still q blue, with a sponge and squeezed it into another vessel thus where it settled, &amp; from the residue I had the ash, flower and subtlest part of the azure without crushing it, which is the best, for in the crushing of it, it loses some of its color. Those who make it in Germany compose it like enamel, in large pieces which they pestle, &amp; pass through several sieves &amp; wash.\n\nTo make azures beautiful, they wash or soak them in a rock water, as they call it; it is a water distilled from mines where azure or vert d’azur is found, which distills naturally through the mountain’s veins or is distilled with an alembic par from &gt;mineral stones of azure or copper.\n\nAzure ashes are only good for landscapes because they die in oil. Only true azure lasts. Azur d’esmail cannot be worked if it is too coarse. Try it, therefore, on the fingernail or the oil palette. If it happens to be sandy, do not crush it except with the egg yolk or, better yet, wash it in clear water &amp; with a sponge remove the colored water after it starts to go to the bottom, and in this manner you will extract the quite delicate flower, which will be easy to work with.\n\n",

Others say that it is enamel that has been reheated. And, from this crust, one can form multiple ciphers, letters, circles and other bizarre motifs. As to the means, I proceeded thus: I once wanted to add a layer of arsenic ground on marble. However, I did the experiment without it, and I put the above mentioned thing, enilanroc, in a small iron casket on the fire of my goldsmith’s forge with three or four small half—burnt coals and blew on it only with my mouth. However, the thing caught fire and became all white, not only on its surface but also inside. And then I let it cool on its own near the fire, since otherwise, exposing it suddenly to cold air, it would have cracked. While it was all white, I passed it through my lead wheel and I found it to be as hard as it was before. And after scraping off a little of the white, I found it to be of a clear fleshy tone. Finally, I polished it and observed that it took quite a beautiful polish luster and that it could compare with a quite beautiful agate for the purpose of engraving it with some beautiful face and applying it to a table of\n- - - - - 013r - - - - - \nagate of various colors. But because this overall whiteness did not correspond with the white crust on the surface that I was seeking, leaving the rest of the thing its natural color, I made a hole in a brick, precisely the same size as the object, and put it inside. Then I heated two glassmaker’s soldering irons until they became red hot and, when they were red hot, I applied them one after the other onto the surface of the object until I got the white crust I was looking for, on which I made the drawing that I wanted, revealing the red background, with a diamond point, and I polished it with hog bristles and tripoli. I don’t know if it would be better to reheat it under hot ashes, and if it would be good to encase it in alabaster, which is quite cold, as I did in the brick.\n\n",

Therefore, in places where stones and bricks are lacking, one can use earth to make walls thin and thick. The best for this is light earth, which does not form clumps when plowed, or better, that which in some way mingled with arene, because it can be most easily beaten and tamped down. It is true that it needs to be dampened and cut into clumps with a ditch—spade, and put and placed in this form. This one lasts more and does not require that much effort, and dryness doesn’t make it split or crack. However, since such kinds of earth are not found everywhere, those who live on good and fertile land, after drawing the width and length of their foundations with a rope, drive in long poles and rafters along the edges on each side to support boards between which they throw the earth, making each layer about one foot thick, interspersed with S.S.S—shaped branches of heather or similar things, then they tamp it down and beat it with beaters of three different forms. One is called the mall, which has a triangular form like A, and this is used firstly to tamp down the earth. Then one uses another made of pointed woodblocks fitted onto a thick stick, and this one is used to properly press the earth at the wall’s ends and edges where they adhere to the boards, and is called [blank]. The other one is called the bat and is used to flatten and beat the earth for the last time, as shown in C. Then one makes another layer of earth and heather and beats as has been said, and continues thus until completing the wall, which is covered with heather and then with earth. Some intersperse the said wall with rows of bricks. They also make walls with a sloped foot, adding width to the foundations according to how high they want to build the wall. When it is old it whitens, showing that it has saltpeter in it. Which is why, when they fall down, gunpowder makers profit from them.\n \n",

Once it is is dyed yellow, pounce onto it such a pattern as will please you. Then you will sew some string or a bigger cord loosely onto the pattern and throw it into a dye of woad or pastel and it will become green, except that which is beneath the string, which will remain yellow because the green dye will not have penetrated there. And you can do the same with other colours and, instead of string or cord, add some pieces of poor quality cloth cut in Moorish shapes on top of the first colour.

Place your glass pane on, as thin as possible, over the printed history, &amp; having cleaned the glass well with lye &amp; ashes so that it is not at all greasy, trace over the lines visible to you with oily black or scales black with a pinceau, if you want to paint with colors in the manner of glaziers, who spread a wash of scales black all over their glass pane &amp; then scratch &amp; uncover what they want to coat with color, leaving that which is necessary for shading. But if you want to make gilt histories on glass with a background of colors, which imitates the basse—taille of goldsmiths, gild the whole glass pane with gum water or garlic juice or fig—tree milk. Then moisten your printed history with two wet linen cloths &amp; lay it down on the gilt glass. Then with a pin mounted on a small stick, follow the lines of your history as if you wished to pounce it, &amp; thus you shall vividly trace it on the gilding of the glass. &amp; next you shall uncover the background &amp; what needs to be empty with a quite pointy steel awl, &amp; and neatly follow once more the lines &amp; accomplish your work &amp; fashion your faces &amp; flesh tones in pounded silver; then fill the background with azur d’esmail or verdigris or fine laque platte, tempered with clear turpentine, mixed with a little larme de mastic if you want the colors to be more unified &amp; not to run. Next, apply on the back of the glass &amp; over the colors a white tin sheet. And once this is dry, you can cover the tin sheet of with color to hide your secret. The tin sheet gives light to the colors. Thus you will be able to paint without being\n- - - - - 040r - - - - - \nbeing at all expert in painting. If your glass pane is bulging as if taken from the belly of a jar, it will show better. When you apply your turpentine colors to your glass panes, first place them on a hot tile &amp;, once they are hot, spread your colors &amp; leave it a while on the tile, then lay down your tin sheet.\n\n",

On the contrary, if the breech is made hollow, as they commonly are, the powder catches more quickly in this place, makes it recoil, and blows. This is clearly shown [by] a arquebus with a chamber which recoils more than another. And since the cannon is bigger at the breech than at the muzzle the sights are also uneven, because that at the breech is higher than that at the muzzle. Additionally, the thickness of the cannon is greater than the caliber by about one line, and the sight by another. It would therefore be necessary to either make the cannon all of one size or to raise the barrel from the end and towards the muzzle, and push it in and lower towards the breech. The weight of the powder must be one third of the [weight of the] bullet.\n\n",

Then, having cut some paper, which has to be as strong as that of large printed books, in the form indicated in D and as wide as you want your cartridge to be long, wrap the paper around the baton B and at the top, where the pointed tip F will be around the aforementioned paper, and the cartridge will be formed. But, in order to make the bottom more uniform, put it into pipe A, then introduce baton B and, in the other end of the pipe, which is marked G, insert baton C and pack so as to compact and press the folded tip of your cartridge, then take it out, and the charge in this, put three or four drageons or larmes. Then, with a punch, marked E, of the same caliber of your arquebus or pistol, punch round pieces on cardboard or felt or waxed cloth, and put this round piece into your cartridge, and push it until the drageons with the baton B, the more drageons, 3 or 4, then a round piece. And continue like that until the cartridge is full, the put it into the arquebus. If you want your pellet to scatter earlier, make round pieces out of paper. If you want it to reach further without scattering, make the piece out of cardboard. If you want it to reach even further, make the round piece out of waxed cloth, or either of leather or felt, and a piece of waxed cloth on the top. And if you make the cartridge in part with waxed cloth or waxed paper, it will reach one hundred paces and will make a big hole, and the pellet, barely scattering, will produce a big opening. But if you make your cartridge with waxed cloth or a material stronger than paper, it cannot be so long, with the cardboard tip being like in D, because it is enough if it wrapped around twice. In such a way, the pellet barely scatters and makes a big hole in porte—corps armor or others.\n\n",

First make the contour of your drawing, that is the outline, lightly and without too diligent work, rather with boldness. By so doing, you will learn to be an artist, and if you need to erase anything, you will not waste as much time as if you had elaborated it. Afterwards work on all the details, not standing too close to your panel, but sometimes stepping back in order to better assess the proportions. Once you are satisfied with the first drawing, retrace all the lines with your paintbrush in pink or another gummed or distempered color. Thus you will work more surely with colors, and with less trouble.\n\n",

However, these things would not otherwise lose their coat or become hollow if they are mixed or include glass tin in them, just like they mix a little glass tin in the soft tin. They carve their work on stones of which the sharpening stones or barber’s files are made. These are found in great flakes near the mountains, and resemble slate. They are found in three colors: one reddish, that is not as perfect as the others because it does not sustain heat ; another one is the color of dark slate, and the other is whitish. When they work a relief, first they print it on carton, which is one finger thick, to serve as a pattern. After planing their stones and rubbing them together , they use a compass or little iron tools to carve their figures. They make their molds with three or four stones, to make a circle or a square with the stones which join perfectly because the stones are of equal size. Before casting, they rub the mould over with tallow, and it the mould absorbs it quickly because it is hot. Then, having put fine powder of quicklime into a cloth, they rub the mould using pounce in beating the linen on top, then blow it a little on top; this prevents bubbles from forming. The main thing is to make some vents. If the work is big, they do as it is shown on the picture. They make a hole in the medal, somewhere where it is least visible, and with a bit they pierce the mold on the side of the medal. \n  \nAnd if they want their work to last, they pierce it somewhere and fit in a piece of cork.

Above all it the sand must be lumped together much like a precious stone or a stone, and the deeper in the earth one gets it from, the better. The signs of its quality is that it is thus gathered together, that, if the stone is removed as it should be i.e. in the correct way, it forms pieces and lumps together, which demonstrates its capacity for binding, and that it the sand is not too dry. However, it should crumble in your hands. And the grain must be quite small, fine, and homogeneous. If this sand is not fine enough, you can filter it and grind it up finely either with water, or through a sieve, when it or on the porphyry. That way it loses its dryness and becomes greasy and well bound. You can mold it in a box mold or in a noyau without wadding, and try it with lead because, if it does not swell and casts neatly, it will bear out well too. Some say that fatty sands do not work for casting metal that is too hot. Artisans who undertake a big job and who want to save money do not need to crush sand and seek the curious properties of artificial sand; they have more to profit from finding natural sand that has the finest grain possible. And for a small job, they take advantage of finding the finest natural sand they can. For a smaller job, they only filter the sand through the sieve. But those who work on a very small scale crush the sand and grind it finely until it becomes impalpable, because they do not need as much sand.\n\n\n  at left middle  margin of folio 088v\n\n  Ground wheat makes a tawny—colored powder that is quite fine and quite soft.

For tin, I believe that it is not necessary to look further to find a material that takes to powder better, and even for use with fine lead which has almost better results than tinTou. The bone of an ox hoof is always dry, that is why you must mix it with fatty sand, so it will bind like tripoli, salts, felt, ashes and similar materials.

From deep in the sandpit, one can find some lumps and gravel that show the sand’s natural compaction; it is quite hard to break, with very small and fine grains, quite smooth between the fingers. And since it is found solely close to mountainous regions or arid lands, you cannot find any near every good town, where artisans live. Thus, if they can’t find any close to their home, they prefer to order some of this sand from afar, like Lyon, Venice or Paris, near the Sainte Chapelle, and similar areas, instead of preparing it themselves. Nonetheless, you can be assured that in all locations, you can make sand from the sandpit and will be good and will mold cleanly. Because the sand is coarse and dry, filter it through a sieve. If it is not fine enough, wash it. And when the water has settled a little, pour the soiled water into another pot. The coarse [grains] will quickly fall to the bottom of the first pot. But the sand from the troubled water pot, having settled, will be much finer. If this sand does not bind enough, dry crush it on the porphyry, thus making it impalpable, and it will bind as chalk does. If you wish you can reheat it, and straight after crush it and blend it with salts, or burned cloth, or felt, or paper ashes, or similar material.\n\n",

If the pith is damaged, the graft will take in an unstraight manner, like with vines of all peach and apricot trees. Apricot trees have a very thin bark, and so it is necessary to graft them onto young trees whose own bark is not thick yet, such as the young shoots of prune trees or apricot trees. The graft will not take if the cutting gets wet. It is necessary therefore to graft in serein and mild weather, not too cold and not too windy. One must use old wood to graft, if one wants to graft on a tree that is already mature and quite big; because if this is the case, it will compress the cutting, and if the cutting is of young wood, it will not grow properly. But old wood resists the compression of old wood better than the young, because it is harder than young wood. But if the graft is done with only old wood, it will never grow beautifully, but will be frail and short and will take a long time to grow.\n\n",

  content: "- - - - - 091r - - - - - \n## Molding with cuttlefish bone\n\nPay attention to keep the bones in a dry place, because they are very prone to dampness. If you have a small medal, divide the bone into two pieces, then smooth the two parts with a knife. And on a dry, smooth rooftile [that has been] pulverized with willow charcoal, rub and polish the two half bones. In this way, the bones soak up the willow charcoal so that the bones will come off cleanly from the cast, and will not stick to it. Then on a fake bone, that is to say a bit of smooth brick of the same width as your bone, place your medal. And then on the medal, put your bone and press it firmly with another stone of the same size. And for a second time, mold it, and instead smooth over the top with willow charcoal and blow slowly, then press as before, and it will cast neatly. If it is for a spoon handle, two whole bones are needed. Any work that is cast is brittle and prone to breaking, because the metal swells when cast, and contracts and condenses when hammered. That is why it is necessary to retrace with a chisel the cast object and in this way the metal will contract again and let it escrouir. If the piece you have to cast is in high relief, first trace the mold and the hollow with a penknife, to make a clear path for the medal and then cast it. And if the medal has two sides\n\n\n  at left bottom  margin of folio 091r\n\n  Rather than casting, heat the bones only to make them lose the coldness and wetness.\n\n\n\n  at left bottom  margin of folio 091r\n\n  When the lead gets too hot, it calcinates.\n\n- - - - - 091v - - - - - \nBecause the two bones are joined, cut around them with precision, and make notches in different places which cross through where the two bones are joined, so as to recognize the place where they were first joined. Or with little shards of wood, you can also pierce the bones, or coat the joints with clay, and leave it to dry. Compress between them it with your two hands in between your knees; and do not use a normal press, otherwise the bones will break. Mold at your leisure two or three times, until you can see that it has the design come up and is well imprinted. And on each occasion rather than putting the piece straight back in the mold, smooth with willow charcoal because it helps it to come out easily. Once you have cast, rub your medal with oil and willow charcoal with a brush, to make it dull. Take care that your medal is not greasy or oily when you cast it in cuttlefish bone. Once you have cast, leave it to cool rather than taking the medal out straight away, because when one takes it out hot, some bone will come away with the medal. Cast at medium heat, which you will recognize because the bone should stay almost white. But when it is too hot, the bone becomes brown. The proportion of lead and tin is equal, one to the other. If the piece is difficult to cast, and composed of various pieces, cast it with a forked pattern, of three or four grooves, and make and make these grooves where the metal is the thickest. Also make these grooves around the medal and directly on the head because this attracts the metal and will fill the figure best. Lift your boxmold a little, once you cast, and in this way you will be able to make several clean casts. Tin that is too hot burns the bone which becomes damaged. Moreover, having come out of the mold hot , it risks breaking. \n\n",

And since it is neat, one molds with it. And one leaves it in one half of the box mold, &amp; presses it a little so that it holds better. And next, you shall cast in your box mold the solder described above, or another more meltable than fine tin. And thus, the second medal will melt and mold itself on the first one without ruining it.

  content: "- - - - - 094r - - - - - \n## Burnisher\n\nThe different parts of a sword are the handle, [and] the sheath of the sword. What comes next is the heel. The rest is the blade. The sides are the edge and the point. Certain blades, acute in point, have only one side filed in the middle &amp; along the whole length, and are easy to break. Other blades are called of three molds or three grips, which have one good rise in the middle, but this elevation is flat as if it were acute in point but flattened. These ones are most certain. Others are called fluted, which are notched from the middle, &amp; when it is along the whole length, they are just as easy to break as those acute in point and are more troublesome to burnish because the burnishing stick can’t get in. But they make one specially that is narrow. Making up the hilt of the sword are the pommel, the branches of the hilt and the cross—guard, which is this iron strip that closes off the guard [and] that is at the end of the heel to stop thrusts from sliding down the hilt. The rings are these two branches in half round that start from the eye of the guard and go all the way to the branch of the cross—guard. The branch that crosses the hilt is called the body and this escutcheon, by which the sword enters the sheath and to which all the branches return, and which holds them, is called the eye of the guard. Following is the wood of the grip which one glues or more fittingly [uses] some mingled wax which is made of wax and pitch, for rosin would be too hard. He heats it lightly, then rubs the wood of the grip so that the tang takes hold, or the threads, otherwise, when a thread frays off, the whole thing will break all at once. With iron thread or dog skin, one also uses glue. The trimming set on the wood, which is made of silk or thread, is called the cord, which is made from two or three threads twined on the spinning wheel, or 4 if the silk is thin. A cord a little bigger holds better. The rivements, which are also made of silk at both ends of the grip, are called the buttons. Some grips are made of silk, seal skin, iron thread reheated with gold and fine and false silver thread &amp; velvet [thread]. Iron thread is of less price and is most durable. Next is that of silk, if one does not have the convenience of being close to the sea in order to recover some dog skin, which is quite convenient. The good skin costs fifty or lx s{ous} and makes 4 or five dozen grips. This one gives a good grip and a sure hand. To put it to work, if it is too hard, soak it for one or two hours in slightly lukewarm aqua fortis. Because if it were too hot, it would boil and spoil the skin. It is sewn with black thread.\n\n\n  at left middle  margin of folio 094r\n\n  \n\n- - - - - 094v - - - - - \nThe gold handles are made with some yellow thin cloth set below or other kind of chalk—yellowed fabric. And this cloth is set on with glue or aforesaid gum. This is in order to make the thread hold better on it. These latter are made of cordons like the silk ones and between two cordons are put one or two threads to enhance it. The silver one is identically made. And there is as much difficulty as for the silk one, not because silk is difficult to twisted, but it needs to be twisted twice. A fine gold handle is worth 28 or 20 cents. The best sword point is of sage foliage. This long stick on which the sword is laid down and attached in order to furbish is called the chameau. It is commonly made from rowan which is hard and even. The stick underneath which is folded bow—like is called the arch. The stick above is called stick of the fustÃ©e. And this square piece, used on the sword to burnish it, is called the fustÃ©e. There are two horns, one is called the oil hornet and the other the emery hornet. There is an iron tool with the shape of a halberd point, square and made of very even and well limed steel called the grateau which helps to soften lime strokes on swords hilts and to sharpen blades once they are softened which is better than with stone or other tools which leave some scratches. To make the swords cut better, the edge from the point is also sharpened. Those who create sword hilts are different craftsmen than furbishers. The fustÃ©e is a three—finger—thick, square wood tool, made of boxwood which fit in the middle of the fustÃ©e stick to furbish. The fresil stick is made of willow wood which is to [â€¦] weapon with some clinker which is the iron scale falling from the blacksmiths’ forge.\n\n\n  at left top  margin of folio 094v\n\n   le banc des fourreaux\n\n\n\n  at left middle  margin of folio 094v\n\n  \n\n\n\n  at left middle  margin of folio 094v\n\n  a b D le baston a felinder c le flin ou pierre de fouldre\n\n- - - - - 095r - - - - - \nThe furbisher buys his blades by the dozen which are not finished, [but ready] to be pulled from [their] sheaths since he does this himself in order to add them well at the pommels and guards. Spanish swords are esteemed to be better for they are of better steel and iron but they are not as well—forged as Vienna swords, in DauphinÃ©. The Spanish ones are not as well sharpened from the forge since they sharpen them with their feet and this is what makes them wavy. Vienna blades cost commonly Xviii or 19 lb. The first thing the furbisher does to his new blades is to draw them out from the sheath, which he does himself or has it done by locksmiths or blacksmiths to whom he gives some liart for their charcoal. Afterwards they pass it over a grindstone to cut it down. Then they lay it down on the chameau, and with some powdered emery, fine and soft as flour, and soaked with oil to make it take, they polish the sword with the stick used to take off the tracks left by the grindstone and then they clean the blade well with the emery. And they add a drop or two of oil spread with the finger to give it luster. Once the oil is applied, they polish it again on the chameau with the “felin” which is a thunderstone mounted on the middle of a stick like the “fustÃ©e.” And this stick is called the “felindel” stick. Once they used the “felin,” they polish it again with some chalk and the oil [already] on the sword. After they follow this and going over it again, they polish it with dry chalk. Finally when they are finished with mounting [of the pommel and guard], they give it a sharp edge with a file. They then dry it and sharpen it and furbish it again with some dry chalk. At the end when they are completed and mounted, they give it [the blade] a sharp edge with a grater. They are polished on a false mounting with the guards which are present in order to find out if they work well together. And employing a blade of the sort of which all the sizes should be made in the hand, one conjectures whether it will be as strong when mounted. One puts the blade in a vice between two pieces of wood, then with a file, they enlarge [it] if needed for attaching the guard. Then to clench it, one positions the place to be riveted and the pommel on a piece of wood. And with a hammer, one beats on the top to make it very level and to secure the pommel. Then with the hammer, one finishes the rivet when the hammer is well secured and does not shake. The wood is placed so as not to put gashes in the pommel. Afterwards one makes a place for the rivet with a file or chisel. And some make the rivet [or attachment] in a diamond—shape but this is not as good as a round [topped one] because one cuts oneself on the corner of the rivet.\n- - - - - 095v - - - - - \nThe end can be bought already made, a dozen of small ones costs six sols but the big ones 2 carolii.The end is fixed either with nails which are fixed on the sides of the cutting edge, but this only spoils the sword and rots the scabbard for the water goes into it via the juncture of the nail. The best way is to apply some resin or glue but the resin is better. And the best is when the end is tightly set and so hot when set that powdered resin on the end melts, in that way it doesn’t fall and can’t be undone unless it is put in fire. Hilts are of different types: Ornate Guttered which is with round mouldings Pearled Scarfed when the bands are crosswise Onioned which is with a flat head In the King’s manner, fully covered The furbishers buy them by dozens, the dozen of full ones costs 10 lb. the worked one, 30 sols or [more] depending on its nature. The first thing that the apprentice does is to furbish as said. And then to adorn the sword and make a scabbard which is the summum of the art. They buy scabbards’ wood pieces which are wholly made of beech wood, a hundred for 15 or 20 or 30 sols, depending on how far they are made. Theses wood pieces are thus called estelles, and have to be very clean and without any knots and are one finger thick. Then the furbisher puts them on a small bench, called a scabbard bench and with a small iron tool similar to the joiners’ bench, they maintain it firmly. Then with a plane, which is like a two—handled knife, they work the wood piece from the top, then use the joyner’s plane to flatten it more. Afterwards, the inside is scoured with a\n\n",

And cut off a branch in which you can see that beside the place where the leaves join the stem, there are little buttons we call buds, the initial stages of a sprout. With dexterity you must, with a very sharp pen—knife, cut in the shape of a graft a small bit of the skin of the tree, which contains a bud or a sprout with the leaf, as you can see in B. Then on the tender wood, which is full of sap, and on which you wish to graft, cut quickly two lines as you can see , then add in the middle a slit thusly. Then with the point of your pen—knife separate the bark from the tree, and open it from the slit in the middle, and having neatly lodged your graft so that nothing is sticking out, only the sprout, binding everything well and wrap the whole thing with a bit of linen or soft string. In this way, there will be nothing uncovered but the leaf, which in three or 4 days will indicate whether the graft has taken hold, by being green. Keep your graft in this way for seven or eight days. Then unwrap it, and join it to the bark, keeping the sprout itself straight, and then rewrap the whole thing gently, but not as strongly as before. And if there is any growth, leave it some room to grow and then three or four times\n  &lt;div class=\"folio\" align=\"center\"&gt;- - - - - 105v - - - - - &lt;/div&gt; \nThen, when the graft has taken hold, cut the top of the tree, which is above your tree, three or four fingers above the graft for the first time. Then, closer so that it serves. But be advised that when you do your initial grafting there should be no small hole at the back of your sprout, because this means that root is broken and your graft will never take. Therefore make sure the back is in tact. This type of grafting can be done from mid—May onwards, because the trees have budded and made new growth, until the beginning of August when the trees are full of sap. Almond trees which are naturally drier lose their sap earlier. Those who want to graft onto them the almond trees mericotons, apricots and nut—tree grafts, which are the best, should do so usually in January. Nut trees, such as perches mericotons should be grafted en fente. It is said that trees graft by the shield—graft method take longer to bear fruit.\n\n",

And moreover, one only puts lead in as an alloy. Contrarily, if you want to mold something strong and thick, put a lot more lead in than tin. And for the one and the other you can put in a little looking—glass tin, but only a very little, with a little resin, when you want to cast.

Because the head is higher, you will have to dig deeper to expose it and do a deeper notch that has to be well exposed, by enlarging it from the outside, in order for the second mold that you cast on top of it releases well. A process for which the animal himself can be useful because his nature so permits. However, make sure that you reveal the lizard’s throat more than you would do a snake, because the lizard has big jaws and big bones that do not cast as easily, and has deep ears in which the wet sand is not as easy to remove. But you will avoid all of this if you expose half of the head and those things that you know do not release easily. When everything is well exposed, blow over it and wipe each part again with a cloth made of swine hair, slightly dampened into salt water or clear water, do that gently, that way the lower part of your uncovered animal will be very neat. # 🝋 Once it is done, dip the covered side of your mold into water for a pater noster. It will suck water inside, that way when you’ll rub with oil the uncovered side, the oil will remain on the top, and to prevent the second cast which you will cast on top from sticking. Dip your mold into water, take a particularly fine brush and rub with oil the entire mold but the animal; it should not be touched with oil. Make sure to use you brush between the parts and on all the fragile parts. And if by mistake oil is soaked, dip the mold into water, as it is said above, and drop by drop the oil will come back to the top.\n\n\n  at left top  margin of folio 114r\n\n  Mold small animals as big ones, however, for small animals, use very fine tacks made of cords of cittern, short and long ones.\n  \nat left top  margin of folio 114r\n\n  remove all the little tacks with the help of very small flat pincers. # then + [illegible] # However, leave the tack which is pinned into the throat so that it will help you to turn the head over, because it is sunk deeper than any other part, because when you drew the plan, you put higher up. It is at the level of the head that you must make the biggest notch and you should start at that notch to expose and then keep following by looking at the traces left by the tacks.\n\n\n\n  at left bottom  margin of folio 114r\n\n  and if a small piece of nail, or piece of tail, or other fine things separate from the mold, put a little piece of wax between them, and join them with the tip of a hot iron wire, then smooth it in your mold with a knife, and make notches on the sides in order for the other half of the mold to adhere to it. 🝋\n   &lt;div class=\"folio\" align=\"center\"&gt;- - - - - 114v - - - - - &lt;/div&gt; \nThis thus prepared, put your first half—mold on the disc of clay, surround it with a clay circle and do a thickness mark similar to the first one. Then, with a rather thick brush, wet with spirits all your animal’s exposed half, without, if possible, missing any part, because therein lies the secret to casting neatly. Then, as fast as possible before the spirits evaporate, soak your sand, and cast it, shaking, blowing, and moving the mold, as you did for the first one, making sure that what you pour first on the animal is clearer than the rest, so that it is soaked everywhere and highlights the finer parts. So, leave it for fifteen minutes so it sets, then remove the clay circle and disc. And, with a knife, join you two molds together in a longish form, like a mandore, as we say, because of how you cast. Then soak a little in water the whole mold up to the level of the joints. Because this is another secret to separate them more easily. Otherwise, you would break everything. Separate them like this skillfully. After this, gently and patiently remove half of the animal still in the mold, pulling it sometimes on one side and sometimes on the other, in order to avoid breaking it, or ruining parts of the mold. The mold, being empty, rejoin both half so that no dust comes in, and put them aside until you want to heat them up, make the runners, the vents and put the clamps. As for the animal, to avoid it drying, and in order to be be able to use it to mold 4 or 5 of times, put it on water. I believe that it would be better preserved in spirits. However, it would be best to make the 4 or 5 molds the same day because these animals rot and will smell within the day. Having left your molds to dry out, for they will stay humid for at least a month, make the vents for one half.\n  \nat left top  margin of folio 114v\n\n  + Note that once you have made your second casting, if you left your mold without opening it for a day or a night, you would then need to put it into hot water or reheat it, rather than open it, like for the crab.\n\n\n\n  at left top  margin of folio 114v\n\n  If after both halfs of the noyau have set and hardened, it would not open if you did not dip it into water.

Then strongly separate the molds as if you wanted to tear bread apart.

When the mold starts being red, do not blow on it with small bellows, because the mold would burst.

Because [otherwise] the gold would turn sour and would acquire some kind of coat. As long as there will be some swirling smoke as you blow this way, it means that it is not soft enough for the cast.

Some people say that counter from Germany contain a lot of calamine. However, when they are tempered, calamine evaporates, calamine mixed with melted latten always evaporates, because latten becomes red again, thanks to the reiteration of melting. However, fresh calamine and only fresh calamine, which is blended with remelted latten, makes latten run, and allow a clean cast. Because calamine which is added to remelted latten is half—damaged compared with its natural state. This half—damaged calamine make latten porous and agitated because it has a tendency to evaporate. Thus add only very fresh calamine to melted latten. Make sure to cast your mold very hot, you mold must become red—hot, like molds to cast gold, silver, copper and metal. If you pour fresh calamine, avoid its smoke which is pernicious. To cast a medal, I took thirty counters from Germany and xii clous de rosette made of doulx latton, like for claires medals which are made of soft latten. This matter contains a lot of calamine like all kind of yellow latten, and make a lot of smoke which prevent latten from running, and make it porous, that is why it is necessary to make many vents and to cast very hot, latten must be as white as water, or as melted silver or as a polished mirror of steel. The second fusion will come out much better because evaporated calamine does not make as much smoke. If you use a molding frame that does not break and holds its own, the second [casting] will come more neatly out of the mold, because the frame is impregnated with the smoke of calamine. If you add sal ammoniac to your latten, this latten will be clear and shiny, but will be even more shiny with huile tingente. Do not use another sand than the above mentioned to mold a noyau, and the mold must become red—hot, like a mold to cast gold. Make a lot of vents. If you cast yellow latten with the prepared tutty you will not get any smoke.\n\n\n  at left top  margin of folio 136v\n\n  This metal is capricious to cast because of the smoke of the calamine. Do not leave it out of the fire, as some do with silver. Because when air or wind touch it, the mold gets cold at once. When you cast it, this metal always leaves burrs, like when casting glass. Foundry workers do not usually use this very yellow latten as much because of the calamine which is heated. They cast red copper and turn it yellow with fresh calamine, or with some prepared tutty. Before casting, clean it with charcoal with a quere made of copper or iron. Then cover it with a cloth soaked in lard blended with saltpetre, or sal ammoniac, in order to protect it from wind, which would cool it down.\n\n\n",

So that the already moistened mold takes well the oiled thing without rejecting it, one warms the water well in order to wet the sand, because with cold water it would be rejected. It is necessary to oil medals, because they do not expand and in this way would break the mold. Animals, which expand, do not need oiling. The hot water much be of such a heat that you cannot keep your figure in it without it becoming too warm. Wet the thickest sand for flat and solid medals rather than [for] lizards and finer things. Once your sand has set, clean and scrape your mold on one side and the other, and on the bottom edge of the thrown side of the medal, make a notch so that it is easier to take out. Lower the mold, scraping what surrounds the medal, so that on all sides you can take it out easily without it damaging the mold. Then make some gashes around the first mold used to throw so that the second time that you throw in it, it will be identical to the first one, and in the same way, make a notch at the bottom of the mold, where the held of the item cast lies. Also make some [gashes] in the sides of the cast. This done, wet the back of the first mold in oiled water, and after the second casting moisten it with warm water if you have molded your medal in a noyau mold. Having done the first cast, and this one having set, cut around the edge of the medal with the point of a knife so that it comes out of the throw and is not buried in it. Then having made the second cast, and having opened your mold, take away the medal in one go, with two knife points, one on the side of the cast object and one on the side of the head, which is at the opposite end.\n\n\n  at left middle  margin of folio 137v\n\n  Take care not to oil your medal too much because if the seeps out, it prevents the sand from serving its purpose and coming together and renders it wavy and lumpy. You must only touch the middle of the medal with the tip of your oil brush and then smear the oil everywhere.\n\n\n\n  at left bottom  margin of folio 137v\n\n  Make especially sure that the throw is as wide as you can on the medal and holds it together well. The gate of your cast must always be big and always narrowing as you go towards the medal. Also do not forget to notch the gate of your cast.\n\n- - - - - 138r - - - - - \nIf you want to cast gold, silver, copper or brass, it is necessary that they be perfectly red, and fired on the inside when you cast, and perfectly reheated twice, if there is something inside to be burnt and cleaned.\n\nThe molds of animals that you burn must be reheated in such a manner that the animal burns up. But if it has big bones, it is frustrating to take out and ☿ often breaks delicate things because of its heaviness. One does not put ☿in molds that can open. It is often molds for flowers that do not open because they are cast in one go.\n\nWhen you want to reheat your molds, fix cramp—irons on the joints, so that when they reheat they will not bend, contract or break. This is done once the cast is made.\n\nThe scrapings of the mold can also be used instead of bricks after being reheated, and also the leftover bits of the mold that have already been used. You can also pat it over important things, like works in gold or silver. You can also reheat it and blend it with water diluted with sal ammoniac, like spar from Germany, and is excellent sand for box molds for all metals.\n\nThe molds with things that need to be burnt out inside them, those ones will not open until the thing that is inside is burnt, like the molds for crayfish, crab, great—horned beetles. Do not open the molds in which you will burn something, not before the thing is burnt, it could be crayfishes, crabs, stag beetles, pictures, and pieces of wax and black sulphur, which do not come out of the mold [easily].\n\nYou must not mold on brick or wood because they absorb and attract water too early, and do not allow the sand to set. The best place for [the sand] is on a fresh layers of clay. And yet, I have experienced that grey earth dries out the mold too quickly. Yellow [earth] is better.\n\n\n  at left middle  margin of folio 138r\n\n  For medals, and flat things, the sand must be quite thick and moistened so that it sets quickly. And when the sand is thusly thick, you can shake and move the table where you mold lies, so that [the movement] makes the sand go everywhere. But when the sand is clear, as for flowers and herbs, you cannot shake it, nor can you do it when there is something attached to wax or other things which are prone to come off, such as the legs of crayfish or other similar things. And if by chance your sand is too thick, you must quickly add some water. And having put the sand in the water, examine it until it is thick on the bottom and clear on top. The clearest is thrown in immediately and then bubbles and the thickest is thrown in at the end so that it strengthens the mold.\n\n\n",

As for the lead, it is melted in a crucible with a bellows’ fire until both the crucible and the lead are red. When it gets to that state, cleanse it anew with charcoal or with a specially made scraper or with the pufts of the little bellows. This done, leave it to rest in it red state and you can even reheat it, then if you want, throw in a bit of resin to burn away the filth. However, some think it best not to put any in because it leaves filth. But when they are ready to cast, they cannot forget to also thrown in a bean—size quantity of bismuth for each pound of lead. And it must be as red as the melted metal when it enters the mold. If the mold is large, it is much better to put in in a press so that they join well and so that the lead does not come out of the mold. However, should this happen, and that for the first, second or third time your mold does not fill up, cast heartily because for as long as your metal is red it will mix and join with the other one and will come out very neatly like the main one. The same thing can be said for pure tin used for thin things. And that way for doing pure tin is one ℥ of new lead for one lb. of the former. Large molds must be put in a press held tightly between two layers of copper, and then bury the whole thing in sand, which is better than ashes, because being heavy, it will seal better. Otherwise large molds are prone to open because the metal is heavy. Some make square molds\n- - - - - 139v - - - - - \nare made of earth or blades of copper, or iron, or wood covered with white iron, in order to bury more easily these aforementioned molds between the thin sheets of copper, estric or one of iron.\n\n\n  at left top  margin of folio 139v\n\n  When the metal is thick, you do not need to cast as hot as when it is thin.\n\n\n\n  at top  margin of folio 139v\n\n  When you melt this often, it becomes sour and fragile because it has to be cast very hot and it makes it half—calicanated. Use new stuff.\n\n\n\n  at left top  margin of folio 139v\n\n  +\n\n\n\n  at left top  margin of folio 139v\n\n  Note that If you want to cast with cuttlefish bone, they cannot be too warm because that would burn the cuttefish. For this effect, try paper. It it becomes brown, it is enough, and it is good for casting, but if it blackens the paper, then it is too hot.\n\n\n\n  at left bottom  margin of folio 139v\n\n  If you want to cast paper with writing on it, make a mixture with half lead and half tin. As soon as it is melted, throw it between two pieces of cardboard on a flat place that is level. And with a point or gold or hard wood, engrave on the left the writing that you want. And having poured the lead onto the cardboard, press onto it the other piece of cardboard.\n\n\n",

And [take] a half quantity of ground coal and neatly sieved through a cloth or coal sleeve, using it to give some color to your wax, that would otherwise be transparent and you will not be able to see your lines as clearly. Put your wax on the coal fire to melt. And when it is well—melted and well—liquified, have, for a full eared—porringer of melted wax, as much sulphur as a large walnut. Pulverize it. Melt it over a slow fire and when it is melted, do not leave it on the fire because it will become too hard. But take it off and keep stirring it with a little stick and when it has finished bubbling and is as liquified as water, cast it into the wax that you will have previously removed from the fire. And mix and stir both of the them so that they join together. After stir in little by little while continuously mixing, the charcoal that has been repeatedly ground, and in this way it will be very well incorporated. This is how you will know that your wax has gone beyond its ideal heating point, it will release no more smoke, it will start to have lines appearing on the side and not in the middle, and those lines will be close to each other. If you cast too hot, you will not be able to separate your wax from your mold and it would stick to the cast. When it is at the right state, stir it with a little stick so that the pulverized charcoal is well mixed in and has not fallen to the bottom of the mixture. And in this way, throw it in your mold bit by bit and not in one go, because wax is not runny\n\n\n  at left top  margin of folio 139v\n\n  This black sulphured wax is for fashioning round figures that do not come out of the mold. And they need to be burned in the moule au noyau rather than be opened like the ones that have something jutting out or an intertwining of legs and arms. And this wax, thanks to the sulphur, will melt with little heat and leave without leaving any filth. If by some misfortune the crushed charcoal remains in ashes, when you open the mold and blow on it, it will come clean.\n\n\n\n  at left bottom  margin of folio 139v\n\n  To make wax serpents or other things to affix to candles, it is necessary to cast them with esbaucher wax of all colors.\n\n- - - - - 140r - - - - - \nnot like other things. And for this one, you can cast two or three times until your mold is full. Now, concerning this mold of pulverized white plaster &amp; reheated in the manner of the sand from the preceding recipes, you should have made it long ago because it is used many times. But, before using it, soak it for a good hour in cold water, &amp; at a minimum, at least as long in hot water that at first is so hot that you can’t hold your finger in it. And note that it absorbs no more, but that it appears very wet overall without water seeping into it. In removing it closed from the hot water, cast your wax in such a state of heat as has been described. And neither the first nor the second casting will readily come out well, hardly, until the mold is soaked. Let it cool down before opening it so that the cast thing not break. You will know that the casting is good when the wax coming back out of the mold is thin and even. Remember to make several castings along the whole length of the mold so that in this way the wax runs better. Make the firstcasting twice as large as other molds. And if, in the first casting, your work fills with bubbles and in so doing does not come out neatly, it’s all the same, because you have to face the fact that the three or four first do not readily come out well. Firstly, you will know whether there are a few barbs that keep it from stripping well. And you will remove them if, on their own, they do not remove themselves in the two or three first castings. And the more that you cast, the more you will do it neatly. And your mold will serve you more than one hundred times if it Is well governed. But it is good to soak it one night or one day before casting so that it be well soaked. The same must be done for fruits made from sugar. This wax is very soft &amp; friendly &amp; pliant, like copper. And if it is hard [this is] because of sulfur, which makes it melt more easily than than other [wax], so much that you can see evidence on a hot slate. And the sulfur that you put inside will be found the second time that you melt it, [as] cracks on the bottom. Having in this way passed through wax, it will not catch fire at all when put to a candle. And in this case, I believe that it will cast quite the medal [illegible]. One uses the same wax in place of varnish to [illegible].\n\n\n  at left middle  margin of folio 140r\n\n  When your animal is cast, cut away the froth &amp; superfluous things with a hot pen knife. And if you want, plait and wrap it around some stick or candle, put it in some hot water to soften and hold it in turning it around.\n\n\n\n  at left middle  margin of folio 140r\n\n  Lower the protrusions of the castings so that they be even &amp; that the wax has more silver so that it can run all in one go without turning through the windings of the snake.\n\n- - - - - 140v - - - - - \nto engrave on silver &amp; copper with aqua fortis. With this [wax] too, one fills the cavity of a relief, &amp; then casts in this cavity, with moistened sand, which immediately takes the relief very neatly. And then you can cast its cavity on it in copper, gold, and silver, and make really singular seals.\n\n\n  at left top  margin of folio 140v\n\n  Seals\n\n\n",

  title: "Casting a crayfish",
  author: null,
  layout: "narrative",
  content: "- - - - - 141r - - - - - \n## Casting a crayfish\n\n  \n The crayfish is one of the most fantastical to cast, but also provides an example for casting other difficult things. You can distinguish males and female by the eggs that the females carry, and by the four little white back legs that males have in their tails after behind main eight legs. It is good to dry them out a bit so that the bumps come out more hard and beautiful, because none of what is made of shell shrinks. It is true that should you dry the little inside legs for too long, they become diminished and have no body. If they are too dry, the flesh separates from the scales. Be sure then to maintain the mean. They have certain hairs between the legs and at the end of the tail. And because all hair is difficult to cast, because it gets mixed up in the sand and does not release, you can burn it by putting a hot iron on the crayfish so that it the hair cannot be seen. As for animals that have hair or feathers, you must grease the hair with wheat oil, which is very dry and which will make the hair lay flat and straight. In this way, you will have form of your animal and you will have the hair. Should it the hair be wavy, it can be repaired. If your crayfish has eggs, which are delicate, and which will be difficult to take out of the mold without breaking, you would do better to make the first cast with the crayfish on its belly and eggs. In this way, you will open the mold with it the crayfish on its back, which will be hard and easy to manipulate. And the belly and the eggs will remain in the mold. And rather than opening your mold for the second time, you will have to burn it with them in it. This way, it will open easily, and what has been burned will come away cleanly. In this way, the second casting, which is done on the first one that has successfully taken hold, separates easily from the first, after having been refired. This is a singular secret for similar moldings.\n\n\n  at left top  margin of folio 141r\n\n  The casting is made by the very thin tail.\n\n\n\n  at top  margin of folio 141r\n\n  If some little thing is missing, you can reattach it or else fill it with goldsmith’s cement.\n\n\n\n  at left top  margin of folio 141r\n\n  Do not forget to rub with spirits before you mold.\n\n\n\n  at left top  margin of folio 141r\n\n  Stag beetles, crayfish and crabs are molded in the same way.\n\n\n\n  at left middle  margin of folio 141r\n\n  If your crayfish has no eggs, mold the back on top and the belly on the bottom. You can give it some.\n\n\n\n  at left middle  margin of folio 141r\n\n  It the crayfish can be molded hollow for the body, but not for the legs. And for a good result, take note that the crayfish is rather fantastical to mold hollow, this ought to be reserved for turtles.\n\n\n\n  at left bottom  margin of folio 141r\n\n  When you open your mold, you will find the crayfish has white bones, but they will not be powder. And without opening it, the mercury will not have affected the process.\n\n\n\n  at bottom  margin of folio 141r\n\n  Apply very light oil colors.\n\n\n\n  at bottom  margin of folio 141r\n\n  To paint it, boil it with wine and a bit of salt so that they become very red and use this as a model. Paint the back with vermillion mixed with laquer, and the sides and the underside of the belly and the legs with vermillion and yellow ochre and white.\n\n- - - - - 141v - - - - - \nLet your crayfish dry a little in the sun, by itself. If it has spawns, they will shrink while drying, and be all the more beautiful for it. Make your paste out of yellow potter’s earth, just like for the other representations. Lay your crayfish on it, the back side down, and the other parts which are more tricky to mold —— legs, belly, eggs — side up. Drive in the back side in the clay paste up to the legs, which is about the half part of the crayfish’s body. Fix the body with a pointy iron thread in the middle and, if you feel you need it, you can also drive another one at the edge of the tail. And in order that the big legs be lower than the head, which is lower because it is linked from below, add a little clay under the head. Then add a bit of clay under the jacket in order to raise it. Hide the feelers under the clay and under the crusher claws, then arrange it as you like. Stretch out the walking legs to the joints, and for the first cast, bend the second part of the walking legs. Fix the joints of the legs with wax and a warm wire so they will not move. If you want to mould something fancier, fix the end of one walking legs on the body or on a crusher claw , using the same wax. If the female has spawns, bent half the tail over the spawns, and keep the shape by fixing the tail with a wire. Be sure that you will be able to clean this part. Finally rub your crayfish with spirits, and cast your sand. Once the sand is hardened, uncover the back side, the head, the eyes, and the small legs close to the crusher claws, and the walking legs all along. One must uncover these parts as much as possible. Then bend and cover the spawns again. The other animals\n\n\n  at left top  margin of folio 141v\n\n  Fix what may raise the two padded edges on each side of the mouth with melted wax under them. \n \nat left middle  margin of folio 141v\n\n  Uncover as many parts as possible, but be sure the channels you make are well stripped.\n\n\n\n  at left middle  margin of folio 141v\n\n  Incline your mould to the thickest side of the animal.\n\n\n\n  at left bottom  margin of folio 141v\n\n  To paint the crayfish, one paints the middle of the back with vermilion, mixed with a bit of lacquer. The sides, the belly, and below the legs with a mixture made of vermilion, ceruse, and a bit of yellow ochre. As with all things, always keep the real one in front of you in order to copy it as realistically as possible.\n\n\n\n  at left bottom  margin of folio 141v\n\n  Lay the feelers on the crusher claws, or solder this part with a wire made of bleached brass.\n\n\n\n  at bottom  margin of folio 141v\n\n  When you arrange the legs, be sure that they do not get over the belly, and that they are well set against the belly otherwise [illegible]\n\n- - - - - 142r - - - - - \nare not so uncovered. But since crayfish are troublesome to burn &amp; clean, you have to uncover them as much as you can, even the little legs just until the tips, because they are troublesome &amp; if, in order to not alter them, you have to take them out, you could break something of the mold. Having uncovered it with the point of a knife, like an engraving stick or another fitting thing, clean off the sand at the joints &amp; elsewhere with your little brush really very scrupulously. And if something is loosed from the crayfish, attach it with wax, as is discussed. And also attach the horns this way. And also do the casting the length of the extremes of the little legs with wax. And refill the holes that have been made with the needles of iron wire with it. And everything being quite clean &amp; having uncovered more than half of it, oil your mold after having soaked the back side in water, &amp; do not forget to oil all the fine parts that are between the legs and the little beaks; then rub the crayfish with spirits. And do your second casting after having made the first mold even, so that the cramp—irons join better. Your mold must be larger on the side with the impression than on the back. Do not open your mold after the second casting, so that it not become clayed &amp; reheated &amp; that which is inside not be burned. Do not forget to mix crocum throughout your sand when you mold the crayfish, because you must really reheat it &amp; the crocum withstands this marvelously. To mold a crab &amp; to mold a crayfish are exactly the same. When you have uncovered your crayfish on one side do not delay at all before doing the second casting, because crayfish dry out. It is not enough to uncover the crayfish such that you see the whole half the half you uncover, but take heed that your mold, even when you are uncovering, be good and stripped, because if the crayfish gets well burnt, you will not be able to open your mold without breaking it.\n\n\n  at top  margin of folio 142r\n\n  Restore it with a pen knife, little chisels, or engraving sticks.\n\n\n\n  at left top  margin of folio 142r\n\n  As you see here, but a wax casting all around &amp; at the end of the tail, where you will do the principal casting, two or three more. \n \nat left middle  margin of folio 142r\n\n  Make the casting with candle wax shaped in a thread like a large packthread, the whole length from the end of the claws to the extremity of the tail. If there is also some claw end or other part that is extended past the rank of the others or is raised up higher or turned up all alone, make a wax casting for it from its end just barely not joined to the body or to one of the large claws or to some other place where lots of metal will be wedged in.\n\n\n\n  at left bottom  margin of folio 142r\n\n  Having uncovered it, attach &amp; secure the two little bearded horns of the crayfish, and anything else that is not secured, with wax.\n\n\n",

And afterwards put in ☿ in order to finish the cleaning. Because if the mold is hot, the ☿ will go inside; seek out the conduits in escaping, will leave its own odor, which will aggravate the tin or other metal that you will cast, such that it will break in touching the mold at all. The heat of the mold also retains some little grains of ☿ that will make lumps; stick to the sides of the molded leaves and attach to them; make them frangible. The ☿ cleans ashes well. Likewise flat things where there are not delicate traces that it could break with its weight. And therefore, if you can cast neatly without putting it in, don’t use it at all. But if you have need of it, mix your crocum sand so that it withstands fire well. And after having put in the ☿, evacuate it, bouncing the end of the mold from below while moving it. Afterwards reheat your mold gently so that the ☿ is gone from everywhere. In this way I cast a branch of periwinkle leaves; flowers very neatly. Having put a branch of melted [illeg] in the flower, on the back of the flower [illeg].\n\n\n  at left bottom  margin of folio 158r\n\n  Reheat your mold until it is good and red before casting, so that the ☿ evaporates well.\n\n\n",

If it is a yellowish—green, you can mix with the vert—de—gris a bit of yellow ochre and scudegrum. If the green is dark, mix in some coals made from peach pits, which makes a greenish—black, in the same way than the bone of an ox foot bone makes a bluish—black. And in such a manner, by judgement and discretion, put the color on the natural flower or leaf to see whether it is similar to the original.

Then you will mold this wax relief once more in plaster, or even better with your tempered sand, #, as if for a noyau. And in the latter throw in some lead and from this you will have a very neat relief, and if it is not, repair it on cement or a similar material, and beware that it should always release well. And this one will always serve you as a model for making as many hollow molds as you would like. In this way, place half of your lead figure which you have oiled, and moisten it with spirits as we have seen above, on your clay base, then mold this half with a white plaster. Having taken hold, and having smoothed and flattened the plaster, take your black wax mixed with sulphur as we have seen before, because it leaves nothing in the mold and melts quicker. Dip it in hot urine, and once it is softened enough, make an imprint with it on your half figure in lead. And you will have a very neat hollow mold. Then adapt your wax hollow mold into a square shape, as it pleases you, as long as you have sufficient thickness, and make sure it is well even on all sides, and then mold this hollow wax; and having it imprinted on one side, and having it flat and even on the other, in the same way that you would mold a flat medal in wax or metal in a noyau. And the noyau mold will give you, whether in silver or any other metal you wish, a figure similar to the wax one, which is to say, flat and even on one side, and hollow on the other. And having cleaned this hollow, and having put it in the bleach, if it is made of silver, you can put into it some sugar work\n\n\n  at left top  margin of folio 169v\n\n  Having made a hole in your clay base and having placed there your half figure in wax, oil it a bit so that it comes out more easily.\n\n\n\n  at left middle  margin of folio 169v\n\n  Transparent wax is not good as opposed to one that has body, for making good imprints.\n  \nat left bottom  margin of folio 169v\n\n  Because you have molded one of your halves with plaster and wax, you can do the same thing to the other half.\n\n- - - - - 170r - - - - - \nperfume and similar things.
